<small>THE SPORTS OF SUNSET ISLAND</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">“</span>S</span>AY! What’s that over there&mdash;there near the
Cove? Look! There it is again&mdash;sticking its
fin out of the water,” cried Billy Remington excitedly,
as, toggle-iron in hand, he stood in the bow
of the large rowboat manned by three other boys.</p>

<p>“Gee! S’pose it’s a shark?” exclaimed Paul Alvord,
who, with Dudley West, was visiting Sunset
Island, the Maine resort of the Remingtons’.</p>

<p>“Oo-oh! What if it is? Let’s row over and maybe
we can have a try to harpoon it!” added Dudley,
eagerly.</p>

<p>The “white-ash breeze” soon brought them near the
spot where the fin had last been seen and Fred Remington,
the oldest of the four boys, rested upon his oars
while scanning the face of the water.</p>

<p>“Look&mdash;quick! There it is again!” shouted Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
“Let’s try and drive it in nearer shore if we can,”
came from Fred, who was as eager as the other three
lads to become better acquainted with the strange
object.</p>

<p>Then began a breathless chase. Four highly excited
young fishermen yelling at each other, or pulling
madly at the oars when Fred so ordered, and cracking
muscles to back water when the need demanded&mdash;as
was the case whenever the queer hulk of a fish threatened
to swim too near the boys’ boat.</p>

<p>However, the creature was already in too shallow
water for its bulk to swim and it struggled valiantly,
if futilely, to make its escape from the Nemesis in the
boat.</p>

<p>“What a whopper!” cried Dudley, while Billy carefully
rose from his seat with the harpoon held in his
hands.</p>

<p>“Now! Now, give it to him!” called Fred.</p>

<p>Thus importuned, Billy tried his luck. The small
harpoon which had been prepared for a chance fling
at a porpoise, was let fly at the floundering mass. The
aim was true but the iron rebounded as from an
oaken plank.</p>

<p>With gasps of wonderment from the boys, the harpoon
was hauled back and Billy anxiously tried again.
But with the same result.</p>

<p>The huge fish was now seen with its back fin clear
out of water in its maddened efforts to swim in the
insufficient depth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
“What can it be?” asked Paul, curiously.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know&mdash;certainly not a shark,”
replied Fred. Then turning to Billy, he added,
“Here&mdash;let me have a try at it.”</p>

<p>Billy passed over the harpoon and the boys rowed
the boat quite close to the greyish mass so that Fred
distinctly saw a great eye.</p>

<p>“Steady boys&mdash;quiet now!” warned Fred, raising
the weapon above his head.</p>

<p>The big fish lay temporarily resting when Fred
launched the iron with all his strength. An accurate
aim at the eye which he rightly judged might be vulnerable
and the harpoon sunk in the target.</p>

<p>The consuming anxiety of the next few moments
seemed like eternity to the boys as they wondered
whether they could win out in the mad battle that began
the very moment the harpoon struck in. The
water was churned as if by a great paddle-wheel; the
spray flew over everything while the fish whopped
forward, then suddenly backed, then flung itself from
side to side in an agonised and frenzied plunge for
safety. The harpoon held good however, and Fred
paid out about thirty fathoms of line before the victim
became exhausted.</p>

<p>It succeeded in gaining deeper water in the frantic
battle for life, and had not the iron held securely, the
<a name="unwieldy" id="unwieldy"></a><ins title="Original has unweildy">unwieldy</ins> fish would surely have broken away to its
freedom in the sea.</p>

<p>“It really looks like a young whale, don’t you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
so, Fred?” ventured Paul, after the fish had quieted
somewhat.</p>

<p>“Nonsense! But it certainly is a queer bunch of
hide and bones,” returned Fred.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the boys to handle their prize
as it was so heavy, but they managed to drag the
monster close to the stern of their boat and then tow
it triumphantly in to Saturday Cove where lay a large
schooner. The mate yelled at the boys and Fred
looked up to find a group of men eagerly watching.</p>

<p>“Come alongside and we’ll haul him out fer you!”
shouted the mate.</p>

<p>The boys obeyed and the mate ordered his crew to
help. “Pass a bo’line ’round his tail and hoist ’im up!”</p>

<p>“Hit don’t seem to have no tail,” complained a
sailor.</p>

<p>“Ner head, nuther&mdash;it’s all bulk!” laughed another.
Fred passed the harpoon line aboard and the crew
tailed on to it. But the combined efforts of the four
husky sailors were insufficient to raise the still struggling
creature clear of the water.</p>

<p>After a time, however, they managed to get a
good view, so that the mate recognised it for a deep-sea
sunfish, or mola. He then sent the sailors forward
for the large hook used in catting the anchor. They
hooked the throat-halliards into this and passed it
down to Fred who tried to fasten the anchor-hook in
the fish’s mouth. But the beak-like jaws were too
small. Finally he managed to hook it into the mola’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
eye alongside the harpoon. With this powerful tackle
the sailors hoisted the fish out of water.</p>

<p>Visitors and fishermen in every imaginable sort of
craft clustered about the yacht, all intent upon seeing
the curiosity and securing a good snapshot of it. With
the others, came the Captain of the power launch
belonging to Sunset Island.</p>

<p>“Hey, boys! What a monster catch!” called Captain
Ed.</p>

<p>“It sure is! How much do you reckon he weighs?”
asked a man who overheard the Captain’s remark.</p>

<p>“Looks like half a ton to me&mdash;but there’s no tellin’
without scales handy,” returned the Captain.</p>

<p>“Hoh! We weighed him all right, Cap&mdash;by the
scales on his back!” haw-hawed the mate of the
schooner.</p>

<p>The joke was an old one with Maine fishermen
and the mate resorted to it without thinking, so the
Captain caught him up instantly.</p>

<p>“Naw, yuh didn’t nuther! Cuz he hain’t got no
scales&mdash;see!”</p>

<p>The laugh that broke simultaneously from the crew
was thoroughly enjoyed by every one, including the
mate, for the mola had a very tough hide but was
scaleless. Its apology for a tail was a frill of scallops
opposite the beak-end, while the most prominent
features were the dorsal and ventral fins, each one
about a foot and a half in length.</p>

<p>“Whad’ye say ye th’ot he weighed, Cap?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the mate of Captain Ed as soon as the laugh died
down.</p>

<p>“Nigh on half a ton, thinks I,” responded the Captain.</p>

<p>That started a new argument among the local
fishermen “lying” in those parts about the weight of
the fish. During the discussion, Fred managed to
shove his boat close to the launch from Sunset Island.
Then he hailed Captain Ed.</p>

<p>“Let’s tow the sunfish over home and give father
and mother a chance to look at the queer thing.”</p>

<p>So, acting upon Fred’s suggestion, the Captain
helped the sailors lower the mola into the water again
and remove the yacht’s tackle. The procession
started: first, Captain Ed, Billy and Dudley in the
power boat, towing the rowboat with Fred and Paul
in it. They in turn towed the sunfish, the latter at
the end of the rope churning up the water as it careened
after the boat.</p>

<p>While the four boys excitedly retailed the capture
of their prize, the launch was making good speed
across West Penobscot Bay to a group of three small
islands lying near the fourteen-mile-long shore of
Islesboro, which divides the bay into east and west.
The boys’ summer camp was on the most northerly
isle which contained about eight acres of land, high,
rocky, and closely wooded with fir and spruce.</p>

<p>The middle island, called Isola Bella, was some
twenty-four acres in extent and was also high and well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
wooded. It belonged to Mrs. Remington’s brother,
William Farwell, always known as “Uncle Bill.”</p>

<p>The southerly one of the island trio was very appropriately
named Flat Island because of its nature:
Not a tree upon it and shaped like a skate with a sand-spit
for a tail.</p>

<p>The three islands were about a quarter of a mile
from each other and about two miles from the mainland
where the boys had just caught the mola.</p>

<p>Great was the excitement at Sunset Island when the
convoy was discerned through the spyglass. As soon
as voices could be heard, and in fact before that time,
the eager watchers sitting upon the rocks of Treasure
Cove were eagerly shouting and waving hands to the
approaching craft.</p>

<p>“What did you catch?”</p>

<p>“Is it a porpoise?”</p>

<p>“Where did you get it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Remington was the first to reach the boats and
help the boys. “Well, I declare&mdash;a sunfish! Haven’t
seen one in a long time. What are you going to do
with it, now that you’ve got it?”</p>

<p>“To tell the truth, we never thought of that,” retorted
Fred.</p>

<p>“All we wanted to do was to catch it, and get it
over here to exhibit to you folks,” added Billy.</p>

<p>“I’ve hearn say that th’ hide makes mighty good
insides for baseballs, ’count of the rubbery quality,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
casually remarked the Captain, with a twinkle in his
eyes.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it a good fish to eat?” questioned Paul.</p>

<p>“Nah! yuh might as well try to eat a meal off of
auto tires and chopped kindlin’ wood served with fish-oil
dressin’,” chuckled the Captain.</p>

<p>“Then let’s get Mose down here and fool him into
believing he has to skin and cook the fish for chowder,”
proposed Dudley, mischievously.</p>

<p>“So we will!” agreed the other boys, and Dudley
ran up the bank to call Mose.</p>

<p>The brown chef soon appeared on the rocks in front
of the bungalow to see what all the commotion was
about and Billy called up to him:</p>

<p>“Bring down your tools to clean this fish, Mose!”</p>

<p>“We’re going to have it for to-night’s dinner ’cause
Captain Ed says it won’t keep,” added Paul.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to slice off the big steaks first, Mose,
and chop up the rest for the chowder,” concluded
Fred.</p>

<p>Never doubting the sincerity of the orders given,
Mose went back to find a huge pan and the butcher-knife.
With his sleeves rolled up and a heavy burlap
apron tied about his waist, he came prepared to
clean the monster fish.</p>

<p>While every one stood about grinning, Mose started
in to cut off the end where the beak grew; but saw as
powerfully as he would, the knife made no impression
on the tough hide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
“Ah d’clar’ t’ goodness, Mis Remin’ton, how you-all
eber goin’ t’ chaw dis elerphant fish?” worried
Mose, as he stood up to mop the moisture from his
perspiring brow.</p>

<p>A shout of laughter from the circle of hoaxing
islanders made Mose glance quizzically at them.</p>

<p>“Ha! that was one on you, Mose,” exclaimed Billy
gleefully.</p>

<p>“Nem-mine, you Indians! Mose got all summer, yuh
know, an’ Ah’m gwine git eben wid yuh yit!” prophesied
the jolly cook, brandishing the fearful knife
as he trudged away toward the bungalow, leaving
the laughing crowd standing by the fish.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to keep it some way until Uncle Bill
comes,” suggested Fred, looking about the cove for a
possible place to anchor the mola.</p>

<p>“Why, when is Uncle Bill expected?” asked Elizabeth
Remington, Fred’s fifteen-year-old sister.</p>

<p>“Not for ten days yet, and really, boys, it will be
impossible for you to keep this curiosity near Sunset
as long as that! You will have to tow it out for the
tide to carry far, far away for more reasons than one,
before your uncle arrives,” advised Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“Can’t we keep it here for a day or two, mother?”
begged Billy.</p>

<p>“Not if the flies assemble for a picnic,” retorted she.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad Uncle Tom and Aunt Edith are not at
Rosemary yet&mdash;he would just love to see this natural
history thing. He’s always so enthusiastic about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
curiosities and all such sort of stuff,” added Elizabeth,
gazing at the mola regretfully.</p>

<p>“Well that’s what they miss for not coming to
Maine before the first of July,” declared Billy.</p>

<p>“I nearly missed it too, didn’t I?” said Paul, deeply
grateful that he hadn’t. “If I’d waited as Hilda
wanted me to, just to spend the Fourth with her, I
wouldn’t have been here yet, would I?”</p>

<p>The others laughed at such evidence, and Paul
added: “Well, I sure am glad I’m here!”</p>

<p>“So’m I,” declared Dudley. “And I’m goin’ to
stay, too!”</p>

<p>Again every one laughed at the positiveness of the
two young visitors who were Billy’s chums at school,
and Paul turned to inquire of his hostess:</p>

<p>“How long do you s’pose we can stay here with
you?”</p>

<p>“Just as long as you behave and are not much care
or trouble. But it also depends somewhat on what
your parents say,” replied the lady of the island.</p>

<p>“Oh, they won’t mind us stayin’ and we’ll do just
everything you say, Miss Remington!” quickly
promised Dudley.</p>

<p>“You just bet we will, an’ my mother and sister are
real glad I can visit Billy all summer on such a dandy
island,” assured Paul.</p>

<p>“Well then, the Sagamore of Sunset Isle has his
work all cut out for him this summer,” laughed Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Remington, nodding at Fred, who was seventeen and
the oldest of all the children.</p>

<p>“Looks like some programme, too!” commented
Fred.</p>

<p>“By the time the season is over, Fred will have had
such fine training that he will have to go to Plattsburg
for a rest. He will be able to pass high in the
physical requirements, all right,” added Mr. Remington,
who had joined the group in time to hear the latter
part of the conversation.</p>

<p>As Mr. Remington finished speaking the bell rang
for luncheon and a crowd of hungry islanders trooped
in to eat every crumb of Mose’s delicious meal. Then,
feeling like a new man once more, Fred announced
his intention of sailing over to Isola Bella to bring
his aunt and little cousins, Miriam and Betty, to Sunset
Island to see the deep-sea curiosity.</p>

<p>In an hour’s time, therefore, Fred landed his passengers
at the float stage, and hurried them over to
the place where lay the giant sunfish.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish Papa could see it!” cried Miriam Farwell,
the eldest child of Aunt Miriam and Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>The energetic islanders finally wearied of admiring
the mola and turned their attention to other things.</p>

<p>“I wish Uncle Bill would offer a prize for the biggest
fish caught this summer&mdash;you know he did that
last year,” said Billy, the financier of the family.</p>

<p>“That makes an incentive to catch something larger
than your neighbour’s, it is true, but I wouldn’t scorn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
to land a big fish even if there were no prize given
me,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“No one would be so foolish as that,” scoffed Paul.</p>

<p>“Captain, how about the trawl this summer?” asked
Mr. Remington.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes&mdash;and the lobster pots, Captain Ed?” added
Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, now, we kin overhaul the trawl and set the
pots whenever you say,” replied the Captain.</p>

<p>“Then the sooner we start the better!” declared
Dudley.</p>

<p>“Ef you ketch any lobsters I’ll be s’prised, all right.
T’other fishermen ain’t ketchin’ nawthin’ this year,”
said the Captain.</p>

<p>“It’s queer where all the lobsters have gone! They
used to be so plentiful that we could easily catch a mess
anywhere. Supplying the canneries doesn’t explain
everything about the scarcity,” commented Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed another thing that has changed too,
since we first began coming to Maine years ago,”
added Mr. Remington. “Do you remember how
rarely kelp was found in this bay then? Now, all
the ledges in the back bay are covered with it&mdash;the
ledges that used to be covered with mussels and sea
anemones.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, but I never thought of it before,” said
Mrs. Remington thoughtfully, then adding, “The cod
and other big fish are now being caught here in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
<em>bay</em> whereas the fishermen used to go way down below
Rockland for them.”</p>

<p>The others had been listening intently to these interesting
remarks and Billy ventured a theory.</p>

<p>“Do you s’pose the kelp has anything to do with the
big fish coming to our bay?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard some of the natives wonder over the
same thing. And the larger fish being in these waters
might explain the disappearance of the lobsters as it
is said that lobster-spawn floats in masses near the surface
of the water at a certain period of its development
that it may be benefited by the sun rays. Of
course, the big fish eat millions of the eggs at one
meal, thus eliminating just so many future lobsters,”
explained Mr. Remington.</p>

<p>“It sure sounds reasonable, father,” added Fred.</p>

<p>“Still, that does not compensate us for the loss of
our delicious broiled lobster,” argued Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“The sooner we fix up the traps, then, the sooner you
can have a treat of lobster,” laughed her husband.</p>

<p>“Let’s begin right now and put them into working
shape,” cried Billy.</p>

<p>“And I’ll act for Uncle Bill this time&mdash;I’ll offer a
prize for the largest lobster caught this season,” announced
his father.</p>

<p>“Oh good! there are just four traps and each one of
us boys can bait and take charge of one,” decided
Billy.</p>

<p>“And remember, boys, besides the prize, there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
some form of Honour in Woodcraft for knowing
fish,” reminded their mother.</p>

<p>“Sure enough&mdash;twenty-five kinds of fish for a
<em>coup</em>!” responded Fred.</p>

<p>“And fifty for a Grand <em>Coup</em>,” added Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Hoh, we can never win fifty!” declared Dudley.</p>

<p>“Why not&mdash;if a trawl rakes up a hundred different
kinds, it’ll be easy,” bragged Paul.</p>

<p>Then Mrs. Remington said, “You know, boys, we
will soon begin our weekly Councils and you ought
to be able to get the low Honour for twenty-five fish
without any difficulty. Dudley, how many do you
know now?”</p>

<p>“Are lobsters fish?” countered Dudley.</p>

<p>“Why, of course they are a sort of fish,” quickly
retorted Paul.</p>

<p>“It seems to me that the Woodcraft Manual says
‘vertebrates’ and that means ‘back-bones’; so lobsters
should not be included,” explained Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I know a cunner, a sculpin, and a mackerel&mdash;that’s
three. And a salmon, makes four, and a
cod and a flounder, that’s six. Now, let me see&mdash;oh
yes! a harbour-pollock, and, and&mdash;I know lots more
too, but I can’t just remember,” admitted Dudley.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Dud, you ought to be named ‘Dub’!
What about the very fish we caught to-day?” teased
Fred.</p>

<p>“Gee, that’s so! I clean forgot the mola; guess it
was too tiny to remember,” grinned Dudley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
“And the dogfish, and the skate, too, Dud,” reminded
Billy.</p>

<p>“But I haven’t seen them yet&mdash;I’ve only known them
by their names and the pictures.”</p>

<p>“Say, father, will you help us set the trawl so we
can try for the <em>coup</em>? Just think of all the different
kinds of fish we always get that way,” suggested Fred.</p>

<p>“All right, boys, any time you say,” agreed Mr.
Remington, who was never so happy as when there
was something doing.</p>

<p>Captain Ed, too, was most enthusiastic about the
idea of a trawl, so the Sunset Islanders went to their
tents that night to dream of hooks and fins and
monsters of the deep, deep sea.</p>

<p>They all met at the breakfast table the next morning,
and the talk waxed so interesting that the usual
object of sole attention&mdash;the star-dish of the island,
creamed beef and hashed fried potatoes with soft-boiled
eggs on the side&mdash;was partaken of in an absent-minded
manner.</p>

<p>Fred and Billy and their boy guests Paul and Dudley,
were full of plans for baiting up the trawl by that
afternoon. The girls, Elizabeth and Edith Remington
were anxious to help also.</p>

<p>On the way from the bungalow after breakfast,
Elizabeth explained to the boys. “We can fish all
morning and catch enough bait for the lobster-traps
and set the herring-net to get the bait for the trawl
overnight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
“How many hooks are on that trawl?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“About five hundred,” replied Fred. “Each one
is on a short line called a ‘gangin’ which is about a
foot and a half long. These gangins hang down
every five or so feet along the whole length of the
trawl. They have the hooks at the ends and these we
have to bait.”</p>

<p>“Gee! How long is the trawl if there are five
hundred hooks?” wondered Dudley.</p>

<p>“About half a mile long,” returned Fred.</p>

<p>Captain Ed was tinkering with the traps, putting in
new heads and mending broken slats. By the time
the boys and girls returned from their bait fishing,
with a lot of sculpins and flounders, the four traps
were ready. In a short time thereafter the traps were
baited and loaded on the largest rowboat.</p>

<p>“I want mine located off Treasure Cove,” announced
Billy.</p>

<p>“The Captain says he has picked out some dandy
places for Dud’s and mine,” said Paul, not to be outdone.</p>

<p>“Huh! for Dud and you or for your traps?” joked
Billy.</p>

<p>“I guess the boys would make good lobster-bait,
Bill, and if we run short of sculpins we will use them&mdash;the
lobsters will never know the difference,” laughed
Fred.</p>

<p>This pleasantry caused a rough and tumble scrap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
on the float-stage but the Captain interrupted them
by calling out the welcome order, “All aboard!”</p>

<p>What hopes filled the breasts of Paul and Dudley
as the boat neared the spot chosen for the setting of
the traps! Mr. Remington had declared the crustaceans
to be scarce, still the boys believed that Fate
would favour their particular traps and attract the
lobsters into them.</p>

<p>Luncheon that day was eaten to the accompaniment
of various conjectures as to whether there were enough
different kinds of fish in the bay to count twenty-five
for a <em>coup</em>; to say nothing of fifty kinds for a Grand
<em>Coup</em> in Woodcraft.</p>

<p>“Fred, you won the fish <em>coup</em>, didn’t you?” asked
Paul.</p>

<p>“Yes, I had it awarded last year,” replied Fred.
“But all the fish I have been introduced to in this bay
were not enough to complete the required number. I
had to draw on some fresh water kinds to help me
out.”</p>

<p>“O pshaw! Then I don’t see how Dud and I can
get the <em>coup</em> this summer,” grumbled Paul.</p>

<p>“You’re one ahead of the number I started with,
anyway. You have that mola and no one ever knows
what a trawl may bring forth,” comforted Fred.</p>

<p>The following morning the baiting of the trawl
took a long time and the boys thought a good day’s
work was done when they had finished helping the
Captain and Mr. Remington. Each herring was cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
into pieces and furnished enough bait for three or four
hooks.</p>

<p>They set the trawl out in the bay starting off at
Flat Island. The Captain’s dexterous flipping of the
trawl-line was the despairing admiration of the four
boys and he did not catch or tangle the long line once!</p>

<p>“Say, but that’s swell work!” exclaimed Paul.</p>

<p>“I should say so&mdash;some class to Captain Ed!” added
Dudley.</p>

<p>Mr. Remington and the Captain laughed but, indeed,
the performance was a wonderful feat. The half-mile
trawl with its five hundred dependent hooks had
been coiled in a tub with all the baited hooks in the inside
of the coil.</p>

<p>Having attached the end of the trawl-line to the
anchored buoy Mr. Remington and the boys rowed
the boat slowly along with the tide, while the Captain,
reaching down with practised hands into the coil in
the tub threw over the baited line with the aid of a
stick.</p>

<p>As the tide was on the flood the Sunset Islanders had
started at what would eventually be the southern end
of the trawl and they worked up the bay. The northern
buoy was anchored as they finished in the sunset
glow.</p>

<p>Rowing homeward, somewhat wet but happy and
ready as usual to replenish the inner man, they reached
the float where Mrs. Remington stood watching for
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
“Oo-oh! What a mess the boys are in! And it
will be worse too when you ‘under-run’ the trawl.
Worse still when you clean the fish. Now, boys
there won’t be a stitch of clothing fit to wear about
here, let alone to travel home in, unless you put away
these suits and wear some old fishing togs. I only
wish I had remembered to make you change this
morning. Come, and I will fit you out as you should
be.”</p>

<h2><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>CHAPTER TWO<br />
<small>WHAT THE TRAWL BROUGHT FORTH</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">S</span>UPERBLY equipped in various misfits of cast-off
fishing clothes abandoned by former visitors
to the island, and some of Fred’s outgrown trousers,
the four boys, shod in rubber boots, could hardly wait
for Mose to finish serving the breakfast the morning
after the setting of the trawl.</p>

<p>Captain Ed and Mr. Remington were found at the
float-stage employed in seeing that the boat was all
ready for the trip. The boys soon joined them and all
piled into the big rowboat and pulled away from shore.</p>

<p>The tide was running down so they began at the
north end of the trawl and soon found the floating
buoy. Fred began hauling in the line while the three
younger boys craned their necks far over the side of
the boat to see the first hook appear.</p>

<p>“Gee! There’s somethin’ on it!” screamed Dudley,
excitedly.</p>

<p>In his mad endeavour to crowd Dudley from his
vantage point, Paul caught the toe of his boot in the
thwart of the boat and stumbled, receiving a flabby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
skate plumb in his face, as the fish was swung inboard
at the end of the short line.</p>

<p>But no one had time to console the sputtering Paul,
nor indeed, did he complain of the mishap, as the next
hook was about to appear above the surface of the
water.</p>

<p>“What’s on that one?” shrilled Paul, not able to see
for himself.</p>

<p>“Ugh! only a dog-fish,” grunted the Captain.
“Stab him and chuck him overboard, Fred.”</p>

<p>“No, no&mdash;wait a minute, I want to see him first,”
cried Paul.</p>

<p>His curiosity for a closer acquaintance with dog-fish
was gratified ten times over in the next few
minutes and Captain Ed remarked with disgust,
“Humph! Guess their ain’t nuthin’ else in the bay.”</p>

<p>But even as he spoke, a fine cod rewarded the haul.</p>

<p>“Now, that’s something like!” commended Mr.
Remington.</p>

<p>“How much do you s’pose she weighs?” cried Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh, about six pounds, but we’ll do better’n that,”
said the Captain.</p>

<p>Then followed hake, haddock, more dog-fish, another
skate, and then three more fine cod&mdash;one of them
weighing at least ten pounds. By this time both the
boat and the boys were wet and slimy so that Paul consented
to have the dog-fish killed and sent to feed and
fatten the future prey of the trawl. While the younger
boys made way with the skates and other useless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
fish, Fred and the Captain continued to overhaul the
trawl and rebait the hooks when necessary.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a rebellious thrashing and struggling attended
the hauling in of one of the hooks and the boys
saw a wriggling mass of coils being brought up from
the blue-green depths.</p>

<p>“Jiminy crickets! It’s a sea-serpent!” yelled Dudley,
his eyes as big as saucers.</p>

<p>“Is it, Captain?” shivered Paul, deliciously.</p>

<p>“We-ll, I shouldn’t wonder if it was,” answered the
Captain, preparing to help Fred disengage the hook
from an immense conger eel.</p>

<p>They tried to perform this operation outside of the
boat but the resistance of the strong wrestler was so
powerful that half of its length slid over the side into
the boat even while the Captain and Fred worked to
free it.</p>

<p>The new passenger had things his own way for a
time after he shipped so that Mr. Remington had to
join in the fray to assist in dispossessing the unwelcome
stranger.</p>

<p>By the time the conger eel was disentangled from
Bill’s legs, Paul and Dudley had laughed themselves
so weak that they sat down upon the slippery mess
of cod and haddock. They had laughed all too soon,
however!</p>

<p>The eel, cut free from the hook, redoubled upon itself
and lovingly entwined the two helpless boys in a
close embrace. Well indeed was it that Mrs. Remington
had insisted upon their wearing the rag-tag and
bobtail attire that day!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
The Captain finally succeeded in heaving the eel
overboard, admitting as he did so, “I hate to ketch
one of them critters on my hooks&mdash;they are so all-fired
ugly!”</p>

<p>When order reigned once more and the boys had
washed some of the bloody slime from hands and
faces, Mr. Remington complimented them upon the
stoic manner in which they “took their medicine.”</p>

<p>But when the boatload of some fifty fine fish was
landed at Sunset Island, the surprise of the girls and
Mrs. Remington repaid them for all of their
vicissitudes.</p>

<p>“How long do you expect to keep up this trawling,
and what do you intend to do with all of these eatable
fish,” asked Mrs. Remington, overwhelmed when she
heard the trawl had been rebaited for another catch.</p>

<p>“Well, the boys and I thought of a little plan to
dry and salt a lot of fish for winter’s use. Especially
as the high cost of meat in the city has turned our
thoughts to a fuller appreciation of the bounties of
the sea,” said her husband.</p>

<p>“Oh, mercy me! Have you stopped to think of the
plague of flies&mdash;to say nothing of the horrid smell
caused by old fish?” remonstrated Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“And that reminds me,” added she, hurriedly, “that
mola <em>must</em> not remain on the island any longer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
“Oh, that’s so, we’ll tow it out this afternoon,”
promised Fred.</p>

<p>“As for the fish-curing, that won’t annoy you, my
dear,” reassured Mr. Remington. “We intend doing
all of that on Flat Island.”</p>

<p>“We’d have taken these fish right down there,
mother, but we wanted the girls to see the haul&mdash;we
were right near Flat Island, too, when we finished up
the trawl,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re much obliged, Freddy,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“And we’ll take one of the cod up to Mose for supper,”
added Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>That afternoon, Mr. Remington and the boys took
the fish to Flat Island while the Captain followed in
his launch with a load of scantlings and tools for making
fish-flats. The mola was towed behind the launch
and out in deep water it was left to float away.</p>

<p>A tired lot of boys lounged about the bungalow that
evening and Billy was heard to say to Paul, “Say, but
it takes a heap of scrubbing to get clean of fish-smell,
don’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yep! I had to scrub with hot water and gold-dust
twins before lunch and then I had to scrub with
hot water and kitchen soap before supper&mdash;’cause
Edith sniffed at me; an’ now your mother says I’m
still fishy an’ I’d better scrub with more hot water
and cashmere bouquet soap before goin’ to bed so’s
the sheets won’t turn sick!” giggled Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
“Ah, I say! It’s too much to expect from a feller
in camp,” complained Dudley.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” consoled Fred. “It’ll soon be warm
enough to strip and take a plunge in the Cove instead
of all this penance of hot water and soap.”</p>

<p>That night as the tide crept stealthily in it bore
upon its bosom a treasure indeed! At last Treasure
Cove had won its title. In the silvery rays of the
beautiful moonlight a <em>mola</em> lay glorified upon the little
white beach.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast in the morning, the
eager boys wanted to investigate their lobster traps.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, boys! You can attend to that
while I take the Captain and get some salt for our fish.
Who wants to go to Saturday Cove with me?” called
Mr. Remington.</p>

<p>“I do! I do!” came the chorus of girls’ voices.</p>

<p>“No sooner said than done&mdash;here we go!” laughed
their father.</p>

<p>As usual, Mose took this opportunity to hand Mr.
Remington a list of items for the larder. Odds and
ends were obtainable at the General Store and “P. O.”
at Saturday Cove although the weekly marketing was
done at Belfast, a goodly-sized town nine miles up
the bay.</p>

<p>The boys were a bit discouraged when they found
nothing but crabs in the lobster traps. However, they
baited them afresh and brought home the crabs.</p>

<p>“There’s awful poor pickin’ in these crabs,” admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Fred. “That’s one thing Maine falls down on.”</p>

<p>“But aren’t they <em>some</em> good?” asked Dudley.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, about one mouthful to a crab,” returned
Billy.</p>

<p>“Not like the ones down at Old Point Comfort and
the Chesapeake!&mdash;some crabs, those!” said Fred,
smacking his lips.</p>

<p>The boys came into Treasure Cove but it was
noticed that Fred frowningly sniffed the pungent air
with nose held high. And great was their disgust
when the bow of the boat ran into an odoriferous
mola. The hot sun beating down upon it that day had
not improved its condition.</p>

<p>“Gee! another dirty job!” exclaimed Billy, scowling
at the prow of the unconscious boat.</p>

<p>“That came back on the flood last night! Now
we’ve got to tow it out and see what the ebb will do
for it,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Say, d’ye need us to help?” asked Paul. “If not,
Dud and me’ll take these crabs to Mose to have him
start boiling them.”</p>

<p>“All right, go along; and if you’re real nice in asking
Anna, she’ll help you pick out the crab meat.
She’s a wiz. at that work,” advised Billy.</p>

<p>So the two boys engagingly won the governess’
promise to pick crab meat, while Fred and Billy attended
to a less attractive duty.</p>

<p>Once more the mola was consigned to the tide,
which in this latitude rises and falls about fifteen feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
at the full of the moon. Comparatively few miles to
the eastward of this longitude lies the Bay of Fundy
known all over the world for its hundred-foot tides.</p>

<p>“Say, Fred, wouldn’t it be queer if the tides rose and
fell here as they do up in New Brunswick?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p>“Why, the Captain was tellin’ me the other day,”
continued the boy, “that the tide at St. John turns the
Falls of the river backward, making them as high the
reverse way as they are in the usual direction.</p>

<p>“Besides, the Captain said the tide runs off of miles
of sand-flats where the pigs go to feed on shell-fish
and seaweed. Now listen, Fred! Do you believe this
fairy-tale of the Captain’s? <em>He said</em>: ‘When the tide
turns to come in it starts with a booming roar and the
pigs know it by instinct as the death signal. At the
first boom they turn tail and run squealing to high
ground and safety.’”</p>

<p>“It may be as the Captain says, but I don’t see how
the pigs can inherit that instinct of danger&mdash;the ones
that learn of the penalty for lingering perish in the
learning,” remarked the elder brother.</p>

<p>“I’d just like to go there some day and see for myself,”
said Billy. “Now, old mola, even if this isn’t
a Bay of Fundy tide, I hope you’ll be carried high and
away for all time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and good riddance to it!” added Fred, as the
tow-line was thrown inboard and the boat was turned
for home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
The next morning Paul and Dudley each had a
small lobster in their traps and Fred consolingly remarked,
“Well, that’s proof there’s some lobsters
about, anyway.”</p>

<p>As the boat neared shore Paul jumped up and waved
his cap. “Eliz-zabeth! E-ed-ith! Look&mdash;I got a
lobster!”</p>

<p>The girls ran quickly to the float and called back,
“Oh, hold it up&mdash;let’s see how big it is?”</p>

<p>Paul had watched Billy grasp a lobster in a most
simple but effective way so he attempted to do likewise.
Unfortunately, he didn’t take up the lobster
in quite the same place and the air resounded with his
shrieks.</p>

<p>He shook his imprisoned hand so violently that the
claw snapped and the lobster dropped leaving its
nipper still fastened in the boy’s middle finger. However,
he was soon released and had to listen to Edith’s
teasing laugh.</p>

<p>“I thought you said you’d caught a lobster! Looks
more as if the lobster caught <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>“All the same, I’ll dare you to pick up one all by
yourself!” indignantly rejoined Paul.</p>

<p>Edith then quickly changed the subject by admiring
the star-fish Dudley had brought back.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried she, “some of them have ten fingers
and some only have six. I thought they always had
five fingers.”</p>

<p>“That six-fingered one must have had ten originally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
as you can see the remaining stumps of the others.
Most star-fish do have five points but there are exceptions.
This one must have got in a fight with a sea-enemy
and had its other fingers bitten off,” explained
Fred.</p>

<p>“I wish I could send some of them home,” ventured
Dudley.</p>

<p>“They’ll keep all right, if you dry them,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Just spread them out smoothly on a board and
leave it in the hot sun&mdash;then <em>go way off</em> while they
dry. When the smell is dried out you can ship them
home in a box.”</p>

<p>“But be sure you find a sunny spot far, far away
from the bungalow,” laughed Fred.</p>

<p>“Dudley can dry them in the shade, too, if he likes,”
said Elizabeth. “It will take longer but the colours
won’t fade out.”</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll make a collection of them and some
sea-urchins, too. And some coral and some&mdash;some
rocks with the funny little barnacles growing on them,
and&mdash;and a whole lot of things,” said Dudley, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you, Dud, and you can keep them in the
Agassiz room of your school,” added Edith.</p>

<p>“When will we under-run the trawl again, Cap?”
called Billy, just then, as Captain Ed moored the
launch at the float.</p>

<p>“Your father said that the girls wanted to go along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
this afternoon and watch the fun; so, unless it blows
too fresh, I reckon that’s the programme.”</p>

<p>Then the boys proudly called his attention to the
lobsters and the Captain laughed.</p>

<p>“Why, I guess I’ll have to get the lobster-car ready
to hold your catch. But that feller lost a claw&mdash;what
happened?”</p>

<p>“Here’s the claw,” admitted Paul.</p>

<p>“S’pose some one takes these two lobsters up to
Mose and ask him to make a nice little salad for
mother; she is so fond of it, you know, and then this
claw can be used, too,” suggested Fred.</p>

<p>As they all walked toward the bungalow, Captain
Ed said: “We went down into Dark Harbour this
morning to bring up another bag of the coal I landed
there last week, and what do you imagine Mose and I
saw?”</p>

<p>By this time every pair of bright eyes was glued
on the Captain’s expressive countenance. A dim
glimmer of the truth then suddenly dawned upon Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;not that mola!” gasped he.</p>

<p>“<em>The</em> same&mdash;and yet, not the same! Kinder ripenin’
up, it were,” laughed the Captain.</p>

<p>“What <em>did</em> you do with it?” shouted every one.</p>

<p>“Well, as long as I wuz goin’ over to Sat’aday
Cove, I tells Mose I’ll snake this dainty along and
lose him in the middle of the bay. So, I don’t think
you’ll ever see him agin.”</p>

<p>Directly after lunch, Edith, who had finished first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
and hurried out, ran back to the dining-room in a
greatly excited frame of mind.</p>

<p>“Oh, mamma! Some real live Indians are down on
our beach.”</p>

<p>In less than a minute every Islander was out of the
bungalow. It was ascertained that the Indians had
come to the Island on a venture to sell some of their
sweet-grass baskets. They had been on the mainland
where quite a colony of city folk lived, but did not
dispose of all their wares.</p>

<p>While the girls admired the fragrant baskets, Billy
took advantage of the unusual visit to ply the Indians
with all sorts of questions. Where did they find
sweet-grass; how they sewed birch-bark so that it
wouldn’t split; where did they hail from, and did they
make their own canoe, as other Indians did.</p>

<p>One of the Indians being very agreeable answered
all of the boy’s questions, and then turned to invite
the Islanders to visit his little camp on the east-side of
Isleboro, near Sabbath-Day Harbour.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go this afternoon?” cried Billy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“We can under-run the trawl to-morrow,” added
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“How about it, Captain?” asked Mr. Remington.</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Mr. Remington. I can set the
girls and boys over to Adams’ Beach an’ its only two-mile
walk from there to Sabbath-Day Harbour. If
these men want a tow we kin tote ’em along an’ save
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
After Mrs. Remington became the possessor of a
number of sweet-grass baskets for souvenirs, the Captain
loaded his launch with the young folks and,
lastly, added the two Indians who wisely preferred
to tow an empty canoe.</p>

<p>The walk over Isleboro was an interesting experience.
On the way, Mitchell Webster, one of the Old-Town
Indians, showed the Islanders the sweet-grass
pond but warned them that the sweet-grass grew
alongside the ordinary grass and was difficult to
recognise.</p>

<p>“Why,” said he, “ruther ’en waste my time pickin’
out th’ spears of that grass I ups an’ buys a pound
from a feller down Old Orchard beach-way. Paid
a dollar fer it, too. Kinder dear fer hay, hain’t
it?”</p>

<p>Reaching Webster’s tent, the children found a squaw
busily engaged in dying the thin strips of split ash
that they wove into the larger baskets. Alas! how
fallen are the mighty! No more the natural vegetable
dyes used by the denizens of the forest. Instead, the
children found printed labels scattered about with
directions for using the analine colours.</p>

<p>The host told the children that he and his squaw
came down from Oldtown, up the Penobscot River,
and camped on Isleboro every summer, making and
selling baskets. The birch-bark baskets, however,
were made in Oldtown during the winter and early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
spring because that is the time when birch-bark is
more pliable and is easier to peel off of the trees.</p>

<p>The young people did not remain very long, and
having purchased a few baskets from the squaw, they
started back for the launch.</p>

<p>On the return walk to Adams’ Beach, having no
strangers for companions, they gave closer attention
to the woodland path and its mossy beauties. On a
slight rise of ground, where the trees had been cut
away, and the afternoon sun shone bright and hot,
Elizabeth found a patch of curious russet plants. She
stopped to examine them and then called to her
brother.</p>

<p>“Look, Fred, what do you suppose these queer little
flowers can be?”</p>

<p>Fred came back but could not identify the hairy
round leaves with their sticky drops shining in the
sun like dew.</p>

<p>“Let’s dig one up and you can carry it home in the
little birch-bark basket. To-night we will look up its
name in the wild-flower book,” he proposed, suiting the
action to his words.</p>

<p>“Look, there’s a little fly caught in the sticky hairs
of one leaf,” remarked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Quite a breeze from the south had sprung up during
their sojourn on the land, and now the children
had a lively trip home in the launch. A drenched
sextette reached Sunset Island, and had to scramble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
into dry clothes in double quick time so as not to be
late for supper.</p>

<p>The main dish that evening was flounder, rolled in
cornmeal and fried a golden brown in boiling fat.
Mr. Remington served his wife and daughters first as
usual, then the younger boys, and lastly, Fred and
himself.</p>

<p>“These flounders are as good as sole,” said he, approvingly,
as he tasted a bit.</p>

<p>“Don’t jab at your food in that fashion, Billy!”
reproved Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“But, mother, I can’t seem to cut the old fish!”</p>

<p>“Mine’s as tough as all get-out!” grunted Dudley.</p>

<p>“Say, what is this slice, anyway?” asked Fred,
frowning.</p>

<p>Mose appeared with a plate of hot biscuits and the
puzzled boys appealed to him in injured tones; Dudley
especially emphatic in his demonstration of the toughness
of his portion.</p>

<p>“Why, look, Mose, it’s like a brick-bat!”</p>

<p>“Don’ you-all knows yu’ own spechul brand o’
fish-steak? Ah b’lieve yuh boys caint rekernise dat
mola when you’se see him!” And the chef’s tones
sounded plaintive.</p>

<p>“Mose!” came a horrified chorus as plates were
pushed away.</p>

<p>“There now, I knew it had a bad smell!” cried
Paul.</p>

<p>“But hain’t he nice an’ tendered up now,” continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the wicked cook, innocently. “Cap’n an’ me
didn’ have no trouble a-tall cuttin’ them slabs dis
<em>mawn</em>in’. No suh! dat fish, he hed some sof’nin’ influence
a-wohkin on him, come all dis time he’d ben
voyagin’ up an’ down dat bay&mdash;ebb an’ flood!”</p>

<p>But Fred noticed that neither his father or mother
seemed disturbed at these truly awful disclosures by
Mose, so he began to investigate his slab of so-called
mola.</p>

<p>“Boys,” cried he exultantly, as he exhibited a flat
piece of wood, now scraped clear of fried cornmeal,
“the Yanks who make nutmegs of wood aren’t in it
with our Mose!”</p>

<p>“Well! we wouldn’t have thought it of you, Mose,”
grieved Paul, who feared he would have to go without
fish.</p>

<p>“You are slick, all right, Mose, ’cause you fooled
every one of us boys,” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“And what’s more, father and mother must have
been in the secret, or how could father have served
the phony fish to the right ones,” commented Elizabeth,
who enjoyed a harmless, practical joke.</p>

<p>Mose now brought in several nice hot flounders for
the hungry boys, who ate with unabated appetites.
Indeed, they had so appreciated the trick that the chef
really rose several points in their estimation.</p>

<p>The fake mola had caused such a disturbance that
Elizabeth almost forgot the queer little plant in the
birchen case. But supper once over, she remembered it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
“Look, mother, what do you suppose this is?” asked
she.</p>

<p>“Get out your flower-book and see what it says
about the sun-dew; this is the rotundifolia variety.”</p>

<p>“Why, the book says that the sun-dew is carnivorous!
So that is what it was doing to the poor little
fly?” said the girl, half shocked and half amazed.</p>

<p>The boys crowded about at this, to see the little
reddish plant which suddenly became endowed with
immense interest.</p>

<p>“Mother, do you remember that story in some magazine&mdash;about
the giant carnivorous plants?” asked
Fred.</p>

<p>“Yes, and if I remember correctly, the story said
they were of the sun-dew family.”</p>

<p>“But they ate <em>people</em>!” added Elizabeth, who had
also read the story.</p>

<p>“It said they fairly <em>reached</em> out and grabbed people
that came near to them,” laughed Mr. Remington;
“but that was fiction.”</p>

<p>“Anyway, you dreadful catch-’em-alive little sun-dew,
you make one more plant for my flower-list,”
said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Mr. Remington then announced: “Boys, we’ll under-run
the trawl to-morrow, taking all hands along in
the extra boats to see the fun. I wish I had a longer
time to stay here with you&mdash;there’s nothing I’d enjoy
more, but I must get back to the city ready for business
on Monday.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
“Oh, papa! That’s only two days more!” wailed
Elizabeth, echoed by all of the other children.</p>

<p>“Papa, why do you have to go&mdash;can’t you stay here
for one summer?” wondered Edith.</p>

<p>“I certainly wish I could, but ‘where duty calls I
must obey,’” quoted Mr. Remington, patting his
little girl on the hair.</p>

<p>“Come, come, children! time for all to be in bed!
Now, let me see how quickly every one can tell me
they are fast asleep, so I can turn out the candles,”
said Mrs. Remington, while the youngsters laughed at
her ridiculous speech.</p>

<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">“</span>L</span>ET’S get at that trawl as soon as we can,” announced
Fred, as he entered the bungalow at
breakfast time in the morning. “Captain says we may
have a spell of foggy weather.”</p>

<p>“Why, it’s clear enough now,” said Dudley, in surprise.</p>

<p>“But look down the bay, that is not a cloud bank
that you see off Rockland, that’s fog,” said Mr. Remington.
“And if that southerly breeze continues we’ll
get it thick.”</p>

<p>“But it is calm up here, so how do you know there’s
a breeze down there and how do you know it’s a
southerly?” questioned Dudley, who really was anxious
to learn the “salt-water” wrinkles he perceived were of
the utmost value in Island life.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see that schooner way down there?
Look, how she is getting the wind,” was the enlightening
reply from Fred.</p>

<p>“See, Dudley, the northerly wind that was blowing
when we got up this morning, has all died out,” said
Mrs. Remington. “And don’t you feel a curious chill
in the air although the sun is still bright?”</p>

So, the breakfast was hurried through and the Captain’s
launch towed the big rowboat out to the trawl.
On the way, they met Captain Benton from Isola
Bella with three of the maids and the two little girls.
Soon, that rowboat was added to the tow.</p>

<p>“We came over to see if you were going to look
at the trawl,” announced Miriam. “Katy and Tillie
want to see the fun so we made Jenny come too,
though she hates a boat and told us she just knew she’d
get seasick.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Bridget?” called Billy, who was very
friendly with the fat Irish cook.</p>

<p>“Bridget said that a sight of all those queer fish
would turn her stomach&mdash;she said to me, ‘Ye see, me
dear, I hev a rale wakeness in me stomack whin I see
sich ungodly craythers.’” Miriam giggled as she
mimicked Bridget.</p>

<p>But it was just as well that Bridget had not joined
the party that day for the trawl outdid itself in the
revelations of the vasty deep.</p>

<p>An immense barndoor skate was followed by a
sea-toad, or puffer, which continued to swell like a
balloon the longer it was out of water. Then came
some haddocks and dog-fish; suddenly, Fred exclaimed
at the weight of the line and there arose to view a
large ungainly monk-fish, or angler.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
“Oh, Captain! don’t throw him overboard until I
get a photo of him,” cried Paul.</p>

<p>So intense was the interest and the fun that only
the Captain and Mr. Remington noticed the fog that
had crept stealthily up until the whole bay south of
Flat Island was a blank wall of impenetrable mist.</p>

<p>“Come, come&mdash;we must get back now!” And Mr.
Remington soon had his convoy arranged and the
launch chugged away for Isola Bella wharf where it
left Benton and his party the richer by several fine
haddocks.</p>

<p>The Sunset Islanders reached the float-stage just
before the fog shut them in.</p>

<p>“Make up a good fire in the bungalow,” said Mrs.
Remington to Billy and Dudley. “And every one see
that the tent-flaps are close shut to keep out as much
of this dampness as possible.”</p>

<p>The novelty of the fog was at first delightful to the
younger boys but when they realised that they were
forbidden to even get into a boat while the treacherous
white veil covered the island, they revised their judgment.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was a little aggrieved, too. “Just think,
Uncle Tom and Aunt Edith will arrive in the morning
and I wanted to go over to Rosemary to meet them.
Now, this old fog will probably last two or three
days.”</p>

<p>And so it proved. On account of this white barrier
the Captain alone took Mr. Remington to Rosemary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Uncle Tom’s summer home on the mainland
below Saturday Cove. From there, the Charlton’s
motor conveyed the now transformed Islander to the
New York express train at Rockland.</p>

<p>The only blight on the camper’s joy in Maine was
the necessity for “business fathers” to leave their
families there and return to the hot city. But often,
an extra week-end was tucked in by both Mr. Remington
and Mr. Farwell. Fate seemed to so arrange it
however, that both men were rarely on their respective
islands simultaneously. Uncle Tom Charlton was
more fortunate as his business allowed him a long continuous
vacation which he always enjoyed to the utmost.</p>

<p>“Captain,” said he to the returning launch-man,
“as soon as this fog clears, we’ll be over to see you all.
Tell Fred that two young college boys are going to be
my guests for the week-end and I want them to get a
taste of salt-water. They are from Georgia and while
they are out-of-doors fellows they have always lived
inland.”</p>

<p>This message was received with interest by Fred
and the other campers and the fog was again appropriately
consigned to “Halifax.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” consoled Mrs. Remington; “use
this enforced curtailment of your liberty by doing
some listing up of your Woodcraft work.”</p>

<p>“That’s so! After we have filled the wood-boxes
and helped Captain clean and salt those fish we’ll just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
look up the Nature <em>Coups</em> and see how much this
Pentagoet Tribe knows about the denizens of the
briny,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Am I in your Pentagoet Tribe, now?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“We will formally take you in at our first Council,”
replied Fred.</p>

<p>“Me too!” cried Dudley. “That’ll be great! I was
wondering how we’d fix it ’cause I want to be in a
Woodcraft Tribe and not by my lonesome all summer.”</p>

<p>Nature books, pencils and paper, to say nothing of
the “thinking caps” were all called upon that evening
to do active service, so the fog was forgotten. Paul
and Dudley triumphantly passed the examination of
the twenty-five different fish they had listed up and
identified. The lists were the same, as the two boys
had been together in the pursuit of this Nature <em>coup</em>.</p>

<p>With genuine pride they copied the list on the backs
of their official Honour claims for the fish <em>coup</em>.</p>

<p>Elizabeth helped Edith print the names of her list
which varied a trifle because she had gold-fish on her
fresh-water list and a lump-fish on her salt-water list
of fish.</p>

<p>“Oh,” cried Edith, “I wish you all could have seen
my little green lump-fish&mdash;he was <em>so</em> cute! Just like
a little mould of jelly.”</p>

<p>“Like a jelly-fish?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“Mercy no! It was shaped like a real fish only it
was lumpy. Captain brought it to me in a bucket of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
water but I let it go again ’cause he was so little and
funny.”</p>

<p>“Say, isn’t it lucky for our lists that we were all
down in New London last summer and saw the fish
there before they were cut up for the market,” said
Dudley.</p>

<p>“You just bet! That gave us a good start&mdash;that
sword-fish and halibut they showed us there,” affirmed
Paul.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, boys! The fog is lifting!” cried Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will be clear to-morrow,” added Fred.</p>

<p>So, cheered by this hope they all retired to their
tents which only the use of oil-stoves had rendered
dry in the dripping moisture of the fog.</p>

<p>The morning was lovely and the brisk nor’wester
blew away all memory of the fog. In spite of the
hard pull in the breeze, the boys insisted upon visiting
their lobster pots.</p>

<p>“Oh joy! a lobster to-day for every one of us excepting
Paul. But there are two in Fred’s trap,”
counted Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes, and one of them’s big enough to enter for the
prise contest. I’m going to weigh and measure it,”
said Fred, steering the boat into Treasure Cove.</p>

<p>A launch whistle sounded “toot-toot!” while the
scales and tape were being used for the lobster, and
there was the Orion bringing Uncle Tom and the two
big boys eager for the sights of the island camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Friendships are quickly made under such conditions
and when the Orion returned Shelby Jordan and
Henry Pou were left for an over-night visit with Fred.</p>

<p>“I’ll lend them anything they need and besides, we
do not dress up for fishing you know,” Fred assured
his uncle and aunt, as they were saying good-bye to
the boys.</p>

<p>The whole island was explored and one of the
things that keenly interested the visitors was the Woodcraft
Council Ring. So many questions were asked
that Fred suggested a Council for that afternoon, that
the boys might see for themselves just how one was
conducted.</p>

<p>“Captain says we’re not going to under-run the
trawl to-day, as he wants to put the fish we already
have on the flats to dry. He’ll take us down to Flat
Island in the launch and then drop us off at Isola Bella
so we can invite the folks there. Then we’ll come
back and hold a Council here at four o’clock,” planned
Fred.</p>

<p>“Take along oil-skins and rubber caps,” warned his
mother, “or you’ll all get wet on the way back.”</p>

<p>The visitors were intensely interested in the fish-drying
operations and asked numerous questions of
Captain Ed. The latter had to admit that the fog
had been mighty bad for the “sweet” process of drying.
“But they always smell a <em>leetle</em> anyway, and a
few days of good hot sun will soon cure them now.”</p>

<p>It is doubtful however, if Shelby and Henry manifested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
the same appetite for salt-fish after being present
at the scene on the flats where the “perfume
factory” was all-sufficient.</p>

<p>The first Common Council was a merry and impromptu
affair although conducted with due form and
in parliamentary fashion. Fred was in the chair as
“Island Chief” which was indeed the meaning of his
Woodcraft title of Wita-tonkan.</p>

<p>For the benefit of the visitors he gave a little talk
on Woodcraft and explained why they called the various
groups Tribes, and chose Indian names in recognition
of service or prowess.</p>

<p>“You see, we belong to the Woodcraft League
which is composed of groups of young folks and older
people, too, who like outdoor life and believe it helps
make better citizens.</p>

<p>“We Woodcrafters prove that sensible exercise in
the outdoors, preferably with some desirable aim in
view, prepares us for the business of life.</p>

<p>“The pioneers of this country learned genuine
Woodcraft from the Indians, and that is one reason
why, here in America, we use Indian ceremonies in
our Councils&mdash;sort of ”America First“ don’t you
know.</p>

<p>“Why should we go back to Greece for examples of
runners when the fleetest-footed Marathoners could
have been given points by the village heralds of an
Indian Tribe?</p>

<p>“When we hold a Grand Council we usually try to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
give it the semblance of a genuine American Indian
affair. Indian costumes and customs are not necessary
at all to Woodcraft but it adds a romantic touch.
Looking up all of these things really teaches one a lot
of American history, too.</p>

<p>“The same training and observation, and what I’ve
heard a professor call ‘Co-ordination of mind and
muscle’ with which the sturdy pioneers conquered the
wilderness enables us to get along better in more
civilised times&mdash;but maybe we’re not more civilised
after all, with this war in Europe and our share in the
savage condition of things.</p>

<p>“Well, to conclude, we boys are the Pentagoet
Tribe of Woodcrafters and the girls, during our life
on this Island, belong to us, too. At home, though,
we have separate tribes that we boys and girls belong
to.</p>

<p>“Now, brothers, we will begin by singing the Omaha
Tribal Prayer which means, ‘Father, a needy one
stands before Thee&mdash;I that sing am he.’”</p>

<p>With this, the Chief concluded and Elizabeth read
the Tally of the last summer’s last Council and the
Chair appointed her Tally-Chief again for the current
meeting.</p>

<p>The roll-call showed fourteen present, counting
visitors, and the reports of the scouts were confined to
the mola and the trawling. But Billy&mdash;or to give
him his ceremonial name of Shingebis&mdash;was interested
in the prospect of swimming, so he reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
on the temperature of the water in Treasure Cove.
In spite of the recent fog it was growing warmer every
day although it never was really comfortably warm.</p>

<p>The first business transacted was the welcoming
of Paul and Dudley into the Pentagoet Tribe, as they
were being transferred from the Grey Fox Band
started by Mrs. Remington the previous winter for the
Baker boys and their friends. The two boys did not
have to take an initiation again as that had been attended
to at the founding of the Grey Foxes.</p>

<p>Then came the awarding of Honours. The two
Georgia boys were quite surprised by the businesslike
way in which the <em>coups</em> were claimed and joined
in the chorus of “Hows” as Wita-Tonkan presented
the coveted <em>coup</em> feathers, symbolic of attainment.</p>

<p>When Edith was called upon she replied: “Oh
Chief! I want to claim my <em>coups</em> when papa is
present.”</p>

<p>“So do I, Oh Chief!” asserted Elizabeth, so the entertainment
continued with various challenges&mdash;the
visitors taking part in hand-wrestling, tub-tilting, and
racing, to their great satisfaction. Shelby Jordan
introduced a new stunt called “Japanese Cane-crawling”
and it proved to be a popular game.</p>

<p>It was nearly supper time when the Council closed
and the boys heard Mose ring the bell. The Isola Bella
contingent said good-bye and were soon on the homeward
sail while the Islanders hastened to avail themselves
of the call to supper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Having two Southern boys present to appreciate his
culinary skill, Mose outdid himself. The spoon-bread
and molasses and cocoanut pie vanished that
night like dew before a morning sun.</p>

<p>Two extra cots were placed in Fred’s sibley-teepee
and the visitors had the unusual experience of undressing
and going to bed before a little fire in the
centre of the tent: a comfort not to be despised on a
cool Maine night.</p>

<p>On the morrow a little southwest breeze was blowing
and the boys all hurried off to the trawl, Shelby
and Henry disguised in old trousers and sweaters
found in the “slop-chest,” as the closet back of the
living-room was termed.</p>

<p>When the boat reached the mooring buoy Shelby
asked, “What do you call that craft?” indicating an
old patched-sail lumberman that was tacking across
the water toward Sunset Island.</p>

<p>“That’s a two-masted schooner,” replied Billy.
“Isn’t she a beauty? Guess she’s old enough to vote.”</p>

<p>“Maine hasn’t got equal suffrage yet, or I guess she
would have been voting these many years,” chuckled
Fred.</p>

<p>“Say, Cap! Look at her now&mdash;she’s trying to run
down our Island,” cried Billy.</p>

<p>For some moments past the Captain had been watching
the old schooner and now he exclaimed: “By Heck!
They must all be asleep or dead on board her. If she
clears the south-end she’ll drift down on our Medric!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Fear made the Captain turn his launch and make
for the little sloop Medric which was anchored off
the float-stage of Sunset Island.</p>

<p>With a booming crash, however, and a terrifying
slatting of sails, the old schooner piled up on the rocks
of the little peninsula-point on the extreme south of
the island, named Cape Horn by the Islanders.</p>

<p>Two lank youths were seen scrambling out of the
companionway of the vessel’s cabin and a third was
observed aft of the wheel. The breeze was increasing
every minute and the situation of the stranded
schooner was such that it was dangerous to board
her from the water. But, it was nearly high tide and
her bowsprit almost touched the grass on the high
bank, or spur of ledge that Billy called Pulpit Rock.
Consequently, it didn’t take long for the trawlers to
land and swing themselves aboard the wreck by means
of her jib-sheets and bobstay.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington and the girls had heard the crash
and the shouts from the schooner and they all ran
from the bungalow to see what had happened; soon,
they too joined the others in the unusual excitement
of trying to save a wreck.</p>

<p>The young skipper and mate of the schooner were
crestfallen for it appeared they had been fast asleep
after a night of dancing and revelry in their hometown
of Rockport. The third youth was even more
disgusted with himself for he had been steering and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
had actually stretched himself out and dozed while
he left the wheel in a cleat.</p>

<p>“You’ve only got half an hour of tide to help yuh
git floated off,” called Captain Ed.</p>

<p>“Don’t we know it,” surlily replied the older boy,
most likely thinking of the reckoning with his stern
father who owned the Edward Everett.</p>

<p>“Well, I kin set you over to Sat’aday Cove so’s you
kin git some one to tackle this job,” offered the kindly
Captain.</p>

<p>“And they ought to do it right away, too, or she’ll
break up,” added Fred.</p>

<p>Without loss of time, therefore, the Rockport crew
accepted the Captain’s offer. Luckily for them, the
wind died down toward sunset. In the meantime, the
boys had under-run the trawl and added to their
abundant stock of fish on Flat Island.</p>

<p>The next day the irate father of the luckless mariner
arrived with two small fishing schooners and a load
of empty blue barrels which had once contained
“Pennsylvania Fluid.” The men worked hard all
morning, securing the barrels beneath the Edward
Everett, then when high tide came the now leaky
old craft was kedged back out of her rocky berth.</p>

<p>“Good-bye, Ned!” cried the irrepressible Dudley,
waving his cap at the departing schooner.</p>

<p>“Boy, you shouldn’t speak disrespectfully of an old
grand-daddy like that, er call him by his first name,”
admonished the Captain, jocularly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
The Orion had appeared in time to watch the old
antique craft retire after her hardy bout with Sunset
Island rocks and when the excitement was all over
Uncle Tom called to Shelby and Henry to get their
things together as he was going to tote them back to
Rosemary.</p>

<p>The two boys were really sorry to go but they realised
that it was Mr. and Mrs. Charlton they were
visiting and at least a single day of the week-end was
due their hosts.</p>

<p>Farewells were said and Elizabeth, who had been
wildly scribbling while the boys were preparing to
embark on the Orion, now presented them with a
memento of their visit in the form of a parody on
“The Last Buccaneer” which she entitled “The First
Wreck on Here.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>The next few days passed swiftly by in doing the
usual camp-work varied by Billy’s efforts to run the
launch&mdash;he was hoping to own one himself some day;
and the other boys’ indifferent success at wood-chopping
to keep the boxes filled, showed the youthful engineer
that they wished they could be with him.</p>

<p>Then came the day set aside by Mrs. Remington for
a “laundry party.” She said she hadn’t the courage
to send such awful clothes to the Islesboro Steam
Laundry.</p>

<p>However, the sting of this occasion was removed
by the unexpected promise of the first swim that season
when the wash was finished.</p>

<p>While the boys were soaking their trawling duds
in hot soapy water, good-natured Mose brought them
a large bottle of household ammonia. As he drew
near the tub he pretended to believe they were preparing
a new kind of fish chowder.</p>

<p>“Yo’ don’ tell me dem are cloe’s yo’ got fermentin’
in dat tub,” cried he aghast. “Why, dey’s got scales
like a fish, an’ dey smells like a fish, an’ Ah b’lieve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
yo-all tryin’ t’fix up a new-fangle kin’ ov fish-soup!
It looks lak some ov dat tin-soup broth! Ah spec’s
hit’ll tas’ mos’ de same, too,” and Mose sniffed at the
aroma with a true chef’s expressive disdain.</p>

<p>The boys laughed and Mose hoaxed them until
every one was in a good humour, then the wise old
cook went back to his work chuckling to himself.
“Hit all depen’s on how yo’ han’le boys when dey gotta
nasty job on ’er han’s to do!”</p>

<p>Then, how the boys enjoyed their plunge in the
sea, even though Paul and Dudley confided to each
other that they were quite sure the temperature was
below zero that day.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington herded them out in a few minutes
and the balance of the day was spent in trying various
athletic exercises to restore the quick circulation of the
blood of youth.</p>

<h2><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>CHAPTER FOUR<br />
<small>COUNCIL THIS AFTERNOON</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">“</span>U</span>NCLE BILL! Uncle Bill! Council this afternoon!”
came a chorus of voices over the stretch
of water between the sailing dory and the Farwell’s
launch which had just made a landing at her
pier.</p>

<p>“You just got here in time: three o’clock this afternoon,”
added Fred, as he steered the dory closer to
the launch.</p>

<p>“Hey! Don’t run me down,” laughingly joked Mr.
Farwell. “There, that’s better! Now, Miriam, come
over here and kiss your old father.”</p>

<p>As the dory gently glided alongside the launch,
Miriam sprang aboard and hugged her jolly father.</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! I’m going to win a <em>coup</em> to-day! I’m
so glad you’re here to see me get it. And Paul’s going
to have one of the green tassels cut off his badge,
too. Cousin Fred has been training us all.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! Fred has so many <em>coups</em> now, I suppose
he can spare you some, eh?”</p>

<p>“Oh, papa! you <em>know</em> I couldn’t take any one else’s
<em>coups</em>! I have to win them myself!” declared Miriam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
“Never mind him, you know he is only teasing you,”
said Fred, soothingly. “But Uncle Bill, Miriam is
going back with <em>us</em> as she has to make out her <em>coup</em>
claim properly and she is going to help us prepare for
the Council. Please, everybody come! We just
count on you, Uncle Bill, to liven everything up, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Depend upon your Uncle Bill! Now, young ’uns&mdash;lively
about it, if you’re going! I’m about starved
and nothing will keep me here a minute longer. If I
don’t show up at the house pretty soon, Bridget will
think I’ve had luncheon, and what a calamity that
would be! See you all later&mdash;three o’clock sharp!”
And Uncle Bill caught up his suitcase, jumped out on
the wharf, and called to his wife: “I’m starved! I’m
starved! Fee fo fi fum!”</p>

<p>Meantime Mrs. Farwell had been talking confidentially
to Elizabeth and Miriam. Then, as she laughed
and promised them to keep the secret, they left her.
She watched them climb safely down to the dory again
before she turned to give some orders to the Captain
of the Zeus, finally turning to follow her shouting and
singing lord and master up the path to the house.</p>

<p>The two girls pushed off from the launch, Fred let
the sheet run out and before a light southerly breeze,
the little dory soon showed her heels to the wharf at
one island and in about ten minutes was lying at the
float-stage of the other.</p>

<p>While Fred furled the sails of the dory, Billy ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
down the cliffs to meet the sailors. “Say there!
You’d just better hurry up! Lunch is most ready!”</p>

<p>Quiet reigned during the first part of the luncheon
as every one was hungry. But as appetites abated,
Billy started a discussion as to some of the entertainment
for the Council in the afternoon. It appeared
that he and Dudley and Paul had a motion picture play
of a jitney which they were anxious to give.</p>

<p>“Have you rehearsed it&mdash;do you know if it is any
good?” asked Fred, sceptically.</p>

<p>“You know we don’t want anything below par,”
added Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Well, if you doubt us, we’ll do it right here to let
you judge!” offered Paul, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Guess you’d better,” replied Fred.</p>

<p>So, the three boys left the table and placed three
chairs&mdash;two side by side and one directly in front
of the other two. Bill played the part of chauffeur
and went through all of the motions of starting a
jitney. No sooner was it running than a passenger
(Paul) hailed him to stop. The chauffeur made the
motions of applying brakes, getting out to open the
door and assist the passenger inside, then tried to
crank up again.</p>

<p>No sooner had he succeeded in starting the engine
again, than a second passenger (Dudley) hailed the
jitney to stop. Billy repeated the same actions as before
but the first “fare” refused to move over in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
seat and the second one tripped over his outstretched
feet.</p>

<p>Again the chauffeur cranked and at last they were
off! ’Twas the “rocky road to Dublin” all right, for
the luckless passengers swayed and bumped in their
seats, until suddenly the car stopped on a hill. Try as
he would, the poor chauffeur could not start it again.</p>

<p>He came to the door and implored the two passengers
to help him push the machine up the hill. They
were indignant but finally consented. The brow of
the hill reached they all jumped in again and down
the jitney coasted. Just as the engine was nicely
started again, the car struck a rut and overturned.</p>

<p>When Billy signalled the overturn, Paul, Dudley
and he, tipped over the chairs and all lay sprawling
on the floor.</p>

<p>A chorus of “Hows” greeted the performance and
the juvenile contingent judged it worthy of the Council
audience.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe we can improve on this, too, when
we once feel the spirit of the Council move us,” ventured
Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh sure thing!” bragged Paul, chestily.</p>

<p>And the others laughed heartily at his manner, but
nothing daunted, Paul added, “Practice makes perfect,
you know.”</p>

<p>A quiet half hour was spent in signing up <em>coup</em>
claims and looking over the Tally of the last Council.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
Then, every one retired to the tents to dress in ceremonial
Woodcraft costumes.</p>

<p>As the last Brave left his tent the chugging of
engines was heard and the launch Orion rounded
the south end of Sunset Island, while at the same time
the Zeus arrived from Isola Bella.</p>

<p>The Orion brought Aunt Edith and Uncle Tom
from the mainland. With them were some visitors
and Miss Travis, known to the boys and girls as Aunt
Flo-flo. Aunt Edith introduced one of the visitors to
the members of the Pentagoet Tribe.</p>

<p>“This is my little friend Trixie Ashe&mdash;she has come
to spend several weeks at Rosemary.”</p>

<p>Trixie was about thirteen but looked older. Being
the only child and always in the society of elders she
felt out of her element in the camp of the young
Woodcrafters. Then, too, she was expensively
dressed in apparel more adapted for a house-party
than for a rough outing.</p>

<p>Trixie looked around with keen interest at the
animated faces of the boys and girls she had heard so
much about during the past few days. Her opinions,
already formed of how such athletic young folks
would look, underwent a sudden change. Before she
had quite finished her survey, Trixie admitted to herself
that she had never met a group of such fine-looking
happy young people.</p>

<p>She turned to Aunt Edith and remarked, “You
didn’t exaggerate a bit, Mrs. Charlton, when you told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
me how picturesque the costumes were and how very
interesting the Island is.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you like it, but really you know, these
costumes are for ceremonial occasions only. No one
could run or feel free in them for actual camp-life.
We have a suitable uniform for every-day use,” returned
Aunt Edith.</p>

<p>During this interview, Mrs. Remington and Mrs.
Farwell were giving Bridget with “the secret” (an
immense layer cake) into Mose’s charge, for there
were to be refreshments served at the end of the
Council.</p>

<p>“Come along now, Woodcrafters&mdash;it’s nearly three
o’clock,” reminded Billy, leading the way to the Council
place.</p>

<p>The others followed and soon Fred, in full costume,
took the Council Chair and opened the meeting
by proclaiming: “Meetah Kola, nayhoonpo
omnicheeyey nee-chopi”&mdash;meaning, “Hear me my
friends, we are about to hold a council.”</p>

<p>“Shingebis will now light the Council Fire after the
manner of the Forest Children,” ordered Wita-tonkan,
the Island Chief, turning to Billy as he spoke.</p>

<p>Then Shingebis, “The Northern Diver,” brought his
fire-sticks to the centre of the Council Ring and proceeded
to make fire by rubbing the sticks briskly until
an almost imperceptible wisp of smoke curled up
from the tiny heap of black wood-dust that fell into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the fire-pan under the sticks. More and denser smoke
followed.</p>

<p>The moment a spark glowed in this powder, the
group of Woodcrafters greeted it with a “How!”
and a louder chorus of “Hows” sounded as a flame
burst forth from the handful of tinder which Shingebis
applied.</p>

<p>“Now know we that Wakonda hath been pleased
to smile upon us,” said Wita-tonkan, solemnly.</p>

<p>A few moments after the fire was burning well, the
Chief took up the peace-pipe and explained that he
was about to perform the peace-pipe ceremony.</p>

<p>“First I light the cedar bark and kinnikinick, or
dried red ozier dogwood bark, in the bowl of the pipe.
Now I offer the peace-pipe to Wakonda, the Great
Spirit and Maka Ina, Mother Earth, imploring their
presence at the Council. The whole Council must
answer ‘Noon-way’ or amen to these prayers.</p>

<p>“Then I proceed to beg each of the Four Winds in
turn to do us no harm from cyclone, cold, rain or heat.
All present will please respond ‘Noon-way’ as before.”</p>

<p>The visitors were quite impressed and when the first
prayer came, “Hay-oon-kee-ya” (Be with us) the
response was fervent. Then, as the pipe was presented
to the West Wind, and Wita-tonkan cried,
“Hay-oon-kee-oon-ee-ya-snee” (Come not upon us)
the chorus of “noon-ways” was so loud that Mose and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Bridget who were now busy in the bungalow making
lemonade, fairly jumped.</p>

<p>“When Ah git done wid dis lemyonade Ah’se goin’
out behin’ dose rocks an’ watch d’ show,” declared
Mose.</p>

<p>“Shure, an’ Oi’ll be wid’ye,” promised Bridget,
emphatically.</p>

<p>The peace-pipe ceremony being concluded and the
Tally read, Wita-tonkan suggested that, there being
so many visitors present, they make short work of preliminary
business matters and proceed directly to the
claiming of the <em>Coups</em>.</p>

<p>“Are there any Honours to be claimed?” called
Wita-tonkan.</p>

<p>“Oh Chief!” said Miriam, standing up instantly to
show her father her knowledge of Woodcraft, “I
claim an Honour for standing broad-jump&mdash;five and
a half feet.”</p>

<p>“Have you the claim properly attested by three
witnesses?” asked the Chief.</p>

<p>“Here it is,” replied Miriam, holding out a paper.
“And moreover, my witnesses are present in Council.”</p>

<p>“Come forward, Miriam,” announced Wita-tonkan,
taking the claim from her hand. He read it aloud to
the assembled Council and asked, “You have all heard
this claim, properly made out and witnessed, and now
what is the pleasure of the Council regarding this
matter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Shingebis stood, saluted and said, “Oh Chief! I
move that this Honour be awarded.”</p>

<p>Paul now stood, saluted and said, “Oh Chief! I
second this motion.”</p>

<p>Wita-tonkan then said to the assembly, “This claim
has been duly moved and seconded and now, it is
ready for the vote, there being no question of its
validity. The Council will please make its wishes
known by saying ‘How’ for approval, and ‘Wah’ for
dissent.”</p>

<p>Then the loud chorus of “hows” brought Mose and
Bridget running from the kitchen to the vantage point
back of the boulder.</p>

<p>The Chief, taking Miriam by the hand, congratulated
her and presented her with the <em>coup</em> feather
symbolising her attainment. She smilingly took her
seat amid the pleased murmurs of the Pentagoet Tribe.</p>

<p>“Any more Honours to be claimed?” asked the
Chief.</p>

<p>“Oh Chief! I have at last completed the requirements
for the last rank in the Little Lodge,” cried
Paul, springing to his feet. “I was eleven years old
last month, so I am anxious to do this before I pass
into the Big Lodge.”</p>

<p>Paul had various sheets of paper signed by his witnesses
at different times throughout the past year
which he now presented to the Chief. Wita-tonkan
read them aloud to the Council.</p>

<p>“Know one wild bird for each year of your age.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
“Oh Chief! I really know a lot more than eleven
birds&mdash;I am trying for the Bird <em>coup</em>,” explained Paul,
proudly.</p>

<p>Wita-tonkan continued: “Know one wild four-footed
animal for each year of your age.”</p>

<p>“I knew twelve animals my first year in Woodcraft,”
said Paul.</p>

<p>“Know one forest tree for each year of your age.”</p>

<p>“I know more than enough for that too; we found
so many kinds of trees at Wickeecheokee Farm last
summer when the Little Woodcrafters spent a week
in camp there,” explained Paul.</p>

<p>“Know one wild flower for each year of your age.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know nearly enough to win the flower <em>coup</em>,”
boasted Paul, looking around at the others.</p>

<p>“Know one garden-flower or shrub for each year of
your age.”</p>

<p>Paul nodded that he had done this also.</p>

<p>So Wita-tonkan read on to the last of the requirements
now accomplished by Paul, until he read the
last one which was: “Know one constellation for each
year of age.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I got that one easy! I only had to know three,
but I was so near twelve years, that I just learned
another one to make four for good measure,” ventured
Paul.</p>

<p>“Which is the good measure?” laughed Wita-tonkan.</p>

<p>“I found Orion and know all about him,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Paul, then he proceeded to describe the Hunter with
his Club.</p>

<p>Bridget, listening intently to this part of the Council
procedure, gasped at the information vouched for
by Paul.</p>

<p>“Mose, shure an’ that hunter must hev been me
ancistor&mdash;O’ryan! He war a king ov Oireland, God
bliss the old Sod! An’ Oi’m tould that O’ryan alwiss
carried a cloob too: a black t’horn cloob it war!”</p>

<p>Moses looked sceptically at the rotund figure of the
Farwell’s cook and doubted the truth of her imperial
descent. But the name suddenly struck him as being
familiar and he remembered where he had heard it so
often.</p>

<p>“Agh, shucks! It isn’t yo’ ancestor, Bridget, at
all! They be talkin’ ’bout th’ Charlton’s motor
launch&mdash;dat’s called ’Ryan affer a bunch ov stars!”
declared Moses, complacently.</p>

<p>“Shure, an’ don’ ye’se tink Oi don’ know me own
fam’ly histry ov all th’ great men what come from
th’ ole sod!” scorned Bridget, turning her broad back
disdainfully upon Mose. “An’ don’t Oi know it war
afther me great-grand-fayther that Misther Cha’ton
named his boat ‘O’ryan’!”</p>

<p>While the controversy lasted between the native
of the Sunny South and the descendant of Kings from
the Emerald Isle, Paul had the last tassel of inexperience
cut from his Woodcrafter’s Badge and took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
his seat with a sense of having accomplished something
worth while.</p>

<p>The Chief then found no other Honours to be
claimed so he proceeded to the entertainment of the
guests present.</p>

<p>“Are there any Braves eager to challenge each
other?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Oh Chief! I challenge Shingebis to a hand-wrestling
match!” called Dudley, known in Council as
Wahdago.</p>

<p>“I accept, Oh Chief!” replied Billy, quickly.</p>

<p>Then followed a mortal combat (?) between the
two equally experienced Braves, until both were red
in the face and puffing for wind. In the end, Wahdago
lost an opportunity and Shingebis was quick to
avail himself of the mistake. Thus the contest ended
by awarding Billy the victory.</p>

<p>“Any more challenges?” came from the Chief.</p>

<p>“Oh Chief! I challenge Paul to a canoe tilting contest,”
called Billy.</p>

<p>“I propose that we defer that contest for the present
and watch any game or match that needs to take
place in the circle. We will go down to Treasure
Cove later for the water sports,” advised Fred.</p>

<p>Then Uncle Bill jumped up and raised his hand in
salute. “Oh Chief! I challenge any one present to
recite original poetry written for this or a similar occasion
which has not yet been heard by others.”</p>

<p>“I accept that challenge, Oh Chief,” laughed Elizabeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
sending a knowing glance at her Aunt Miriam.</p>

<p>Thereupon, Uncle Bill drew forth a paper and
cleared his throat. Having made obeisance to the
Chief and then to the guests, he read:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="center">Mpret.</p>
<div class="verse">
  <div class="line">On Albania’s throne</div>
  <div class="line indent">When the war clouds met</div>
  <div class="line">Shivering alone</div>
  <div class="line indent">Sat little Mpret.</div>
  <div class="line">Said he to himself</div>
  <div class="line indent">“As Wilyum of Wied</div>

  <div class="line">The throne is empty:</div>
  <div class="line indent">“It’s the one best bet,</div>
  <div class="line">It will stay that way!”</div>
  <div class="line indent">Said little Mpret.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Applause greeted the conclusion of this little skit
and Uncle Bill resumed his seat, bowing with a conqueror’s
air, as if to say he knew the laurels were his.
But he also knew that he had no mean competitor in
Elizabeth, who now stood up and prefaced her verse.</p>

<p>“Every one here knows that the first sail of the season
is not all joy&mdash;particularly if it is choppy, or if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
there is a heavy sea on and the wind falls and the
craft bobs around helplessly. If you are not accustomed
to the motion and you lose interest in the sights
and sounds, you may also begin to lose other things
as well.”</p>

<p>Several of those present began to laugh for they
sensed the trend of Elizabeth’s prologue as referring
to a sickly time Uncle Bill experienced during his first
sail on troubled waters.</p>

<p>“My poem is called ‘Sea-sick,’” explained Elizabeth.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="verse">
<div class="line">“The mate was sick, the Captain too,</div>
<div class="line indent">The passengers and ‘hand’;</div>
<div class="line">The breeze was strong enough to slew</div>

</div><div class="verse">

<div class="line indent">The way we just did feel!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>
<p>When Elizabeth finished, every one cried “How”
and Aunt Edith declared she was deeply affected by
the vivid description&mdash;it almost made her seasick!</p>

<p>“Who was mate on that trip?” asked Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>“Fred was mate and I was the ‘hand’ but I won’t
tell tales on the Captain&mdash;let him speak for himself,”
laughed Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Well, I was the passenger and I can swear to <em>my</em>
feelings,” exclaimed Billy, looking at his Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>But Uncle Bill returned the look boldly and murmured:
“From what you say, that sure must have
been some sail!”</p>

<p>“Wah! Wah!” cried a number of voices and everyone
laughed.</p>

<p>The poetry had to be judged for other virtues than
mere fidelity of description, so the “palm” was
awarded to the composer of “Mpret.”</p>

<p>Following this verse contest, Billy announced that he
and two friends would produce a moving picture play
depicting a jitney in distress. So many impromptu
additions were shown that the rough and tumble
“movie” was highly applauded by the other children.</p>

<p>This over, the Chief stood up. “For a change in
the programme, I think we will call upon Pah-hlee-oh,
The Moon Maid, to entertain us by dancing the
Storm Cloud.”</p>

<p>Fred had signalled Elizabeth while the Jitney act
was being done, and she slipped away from the circle
unseen by the others. At the beating of the tom-toms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
she now appeared from behind a group of trees, holding
a long white veil behind her head. The veil was
of chiffon and the light breeze wafted it gracefully
about as the dancer entered the Council Ring.</p>

<p>The Storm Cloud dance is one of the most graceful
of the Indian Dances and Elizabeth was well-trained
so a genuine treat was given the visitors that day.</p>

<p>Then to the surprise of every one present, Uncle
Tom stood and said, “I challenge Uncle Bill to a tub-tilting
match.”</p>

<p>This also proved a great success, for Uncle Bill,
always ready to provoke fun and laughter, did his
part with great gusto. The result was that the exact
rules were not followed but far greater sport was
furnished by the two heavy performers in unexpected
actions and twists and ferocious grimaces.</p>

<p>After a Folk Song contest and Character Dances
were given, every one walked down to the Cove to
watch the canoe tilting between the two boys with
Captain Ed and Benton as seconds. This was interesting
as the boys were well matched, but Billy came
off victorious at last, having upset his opponent by
thrusting the soft-padded pole suddenly in the pit of
his stomach.</p>

<p>Billy and Dudley dressed and then a Talk Fest was
started by the Chief against Dudley; as they finished
the victory was accorded Dudley with the remark,
“He’s the fastest talker on the hemisphere!”</p>

<p>The appearance of Mose, carrying a huge tray of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
refreshments, now put to flight any other ideas of
sport, and when the ever-hungry Woodcrafters were
satisfied, the obliging waiter flopped down in a kitchen
chair and looked wearily up at Bridget for consolation.</p>

<p>“Ah d’clare t’ goodness, d’ way dem fo’kses ack in
dat Woodcraf’ bisnis, an’ den go an’ git such empty
stomacks, is amusin’ t’ me! Jus’ look at dem vacant
plates&mdash;would yo’ b’lieve dey had ben piled up high
wid san’witches an’ fixin’s t’ say nuffin of th’ cake
an’ lemyonade!”</p>

<p>Bridget had been taxed to the limit by the great demand
for lemonade, and she sniffed disdainfully:
“’Twar mesilf ez beat twelve aigs in th’ layer cake!
No wonder it melted away like snow in July! Not a
crumb fer the cook, ayther!”</p>

<p>Mose looked compassionately at the defrauded cook
and remarked: “Ah’ve hearn say dat a <em>good</em> chef
neveh gits lef’ fo’ a bite! Now Ah’m a <em>fust</em>-class
cook so Ah had a good big snack o’ dat twelve aig
cake befoh it passed outen my control!”</p>

<p>Bridget sent Mose a resentful look and flounced
angrily from the kitchen, while Mose shook with
silent amusement at his competitor in culinary arts.</p>

<p>The guests departed in the sunset glow and the
Pentagoet Tribe felt that they had acquitted themselves
unusually well, thereby earning a good night’s
sleep.</p>

<h2><a name="v" id="v"></a>CHAPTER FIVE<br />
<small>WINNING THE DEGREE OF SHINGEBIS</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">F</span>OR the next few days the Island Tribe was busy
getting up Swimming <em>Coups</em>. Shingebis made
sure he had passed the necessary tests for the Swimming
Degree. He had won the <em>coup</em> for swimming
one hundred yards a long time before but had now to
swim with all clothes on. This promised to be great
sport and every one looked forward to the exhibition
with delight.</p>

<p>The morning dawned bright and warm. By eleven
A. M. the sun shone hot upon the calm bay, and the
high tide before luncheon was just what was wanted
for the exhibitors.</p>

<p>Miriam and her little sister Betty arrived about ten
o’clock and shortly after, the Rosemary Aunt and
Uncle with Trixie came scrambling up the steps from
the floating-stage. Soon the procession of “Annette
Kellermans” in rubber bathing caps of every colour,
and the boys brown-legged and brown-armed, ran
down the well-worn path leading to Treasure Cove,
a genuine Island sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Suddenly Fred stopped and turned to Billy who unexpectedly
collided with him.</p>

<p>“Say! We forgot the sand bag!” exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>“Gee! So we have&mdash;I’ll run back and hunt one,”
offered Billy, starting for the bungalow to find a
bag that would hold the necessary five pounds of sand.</p>

<p>“I’ll go, too!” called Paul, following Billy.</p>

<p>At the kitchen door, Billy hailed the cook.</p>

<p>“Say, Mose, got a bag that’ll hold five pounds?”
asked Billy, looking about quickly.</p>

<p>“Wha’fo’, Chile?” wondered Mose, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have to do a stunt for a <em>coup</em>&mdash;a strong white
salt bag will do.”</p>

<p>“Ah reckon Ah kin len’ yo’ th’ cook-salt bag but
don’ yo’ go an’ waste enny salt outen the bag. Ah jes’
got this lot o’ salt an’ its gotta las’ me a fo’tnight!”
As he spoke Mose took the full salt-bag from the shelf
to hand to Billy.</p>

<p>“Pooh! We can’t use your old salt&mdash;all I want is
the <em>bag</em>!” laughed Billy, rummaging about in the
kitchen cupboard.</p>

<p>“See heah, Bo! don yo’ go t’ dislodgin’ m’ pots an’
pans now! Jes’ give Mose time t’ dig out a bag, will
yo’?” So saying, the southern cook yanked a crate
out from a corner and lifted a heavy burlap bag
therefrom.</p>

<p>“How’s dis? It’ll onny take a shake t’ dump out th’
rock salt&mdash;er kin yo’ use the hull thing jus’ as it is?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Billy laughed and Paul declared, “Mose, you’re a
numm-skull, sure as shootin’.”</p>

<p>“You see, Mose,” explained Billy, “before that bag
of salt was in the water very long it would be melted
and a cinch for any diver to bring up from the bottom.
I am going to try out the test for diving and
we must have a white bag holding just five pounds of
sand. White, so I can see it under water, you know.
The sand will wash out of a loose-meshed bag like
burlap, and it wouldn’t weigh more than two or three
pounds by the time I had it on shore, and that wouldn’t
be fair.”</p>

<p>“Sho, nuff! A flour bag is jus what yo’ want&mdash;an’
Ah emptied one dis mawnin’, too. Yo’ kin weigh
five poun’s on dis scale, Ah reckon,” agreed Mose,
handing Billy the scale and going for the bag.</p>

<p>“By the way, Mose, aren’t you coming down to
watch the fun?” asked Paul, as they took the bag
and started away.</p>

<p>“Ah shore am, Honey! Jes’ waitin’ t’ remove dis pan
o’ biskits from d’ oven!”</p>

<p>“Let’s run across to the float and get another boat,”
suggested Paul.</p>

<p>“Good idea&mdash;we’ll need an extra boat anyway,”
approved Billy.</p>

<p>When the two boys arrived in Treasure Cove with
the bag and scales, Fred carefully weighed out five
pounds of sand while Billy prepared himself for the
dive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Paul stood watching Billy heft the bag of sand and
became imbued with the spirit of achievement.</p>

<p>“Ever try it before, Billy?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Lots of times, but never before three witnesses who
will attest the dive.”</p>

<p>“When you finish, guess I’ll do it, too!” said Paul.</p>

<p>“Maybe you think it’s easy, eh?” queried Billy,
laughing.</p>

<p>“I’m a good diver now, and grabbing a bag of sand
isn’t anything to do,” said Paul, boastfully.</p>

<p>“Well, just try it!”</p>

<p>Fred had marked off a pole into foot lengths and
this he placed in the canoe. After paddling out to the
middle of the Cove he used the pole to measure the
depths and when he had found the depth of eight or
nine feet he called to Elizabeth, who was following
the canoe in a boat with Billy and the bag of sand, for
passenger and freight.</p>

<p>“Now lift that bag out and drop it carefully just
here where the pole stands&mdash;don’t fall over with it,
though,” ordered Fred, watching as his sister followed
his directions.</p>

<p>“Bill, wait a few seconds for the ripples to settle
and when you dive look for the white object right
under this spot.”</p>

<p>Billy did as he was told and in a few seconds he was
in and almost immediately after appeared again bringing
the bag of sand up with him. A loud chorus of
“Hows” greeted him as he swam in to shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
“Now I’m going to do it!” cried Paul.</p>

<p>“Why you never tried before,” said Miriam.</p>

<p>“No, but it’s so easy! I might as well pass the test
now as later,” bragged Paul, swimming out to the
boat.</p>

<p>Fred had paddled in and now carried the bag out to
the same place and dropped it in but Paul, try as he
would, could not find it.</p>

<p>“I know what’s the trouble&mdash;Paul doesn’t keep his
eyes open. He closes them tight the moment he
strikes the water,” cried Elizabeth to Fred.</p>

<p>So Fred called to Paul, “How do you expect to find
an object under water if your eyes are shut?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid to open them, it feels awful,” said
Paul.</p>

<p>“Well, the sooner you learn to do that the better.
No swimmer can become expert if he dives or swims
under water with closed eyes,” remarked Fred, starting
to paddle back to land.</p>

<p>“Oh Fred, while we are here let us try for a test
for swimming the breast, overhand, and crawl, in to
shore,” cried Paul, and this was done very well although
Dudley did it better, having had much more
practice at home.</p>

<p>Meantime, Billy had dressed in a complete suit of
old clothes&mdash;with shoes, cap and coat&mdash;as he proposed
to try the test of swimming with all clothes on.</p>

<p>Wita-tonkan took the measuring tape and fastened
it on one end of the rock that jutted out over the Cove,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
then Elizabeth paddled the canoe out to the required
distance and waited. Edith, Paul and Billy followed
in the boat and stopped alongside the line of limit.</p>

<p>Every one was watching eagerly as Billy dove off
the end of the boat and swam for shore. Then, as he
reached the rocky island and clambered out, a chorus
of “Hows” congratulated him.</p>

<p>“Huh! That was nothing! Now, watch me do
some <em>real</em> stunts in swimming,” laughed he.</p>

<p>“Not to-day, Billy. Go and dress now and leave
your fancy swimming for another time,” advised Mrs.
Remington.</p>

<p>Billy obeyed but his face expressed his reluctance.</p>

<p>Meantime Fred was sure that he could overturn a
canoe in the water and right it again if some one would
stand by while he tried the difficult stunt. Captain
Ed offered his services.</p>

<p>While Fred was striving to accomplish this deed,
some one suggested a “splashing match” and before
a place of dry safety could be reached by the grown-ups
who had been sitting near the edge of the water,
every one was liberally sprinkled by the merry water
nymphs. So much noise did they make indeed, that
Aunt Edith called for more quiet.</p>

<p>“Oh, but noise is part of the game, you know!”
retorted Billy, who was watching from the sunny
rocks since he could not take part in the fun.</p>

<p>The match ended when Paul ducked Edith under
water. As soon as she could sputter, she wildly denounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
him, but Billy and Dudley laughed heartily as
they told her to “get even.”</p>

<p>Paul hurriedly got out of Edith’s way for she had
very good muscle for a girl and Paul had been made
aware of its power several times previously to this
day.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was floating serenely when Edith confided
to her that she had kept her eyes open when Paul
unexpectedly pushed her under water.</p>

<p>“And it felt so strange that I’m going to try it
again.”</p>

<p>“That’s right! No diver is any good until he can
see where he is going or what he really is after under
water. Why not get the others to try, too,” replied
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>So they were all trying to dive and keep their eyes
open. “The one who keeps his eyes open the longest
while under water will be given an extra dish of dessert
at lunch time,” cried Billy.</p>

<p>“But it feels so funny to have the water biff your
eyes,” commented Paul, who had experimented when
the others did.</p>

<p>“Why, I don’t know whether I see anything or not!
I tried but couldn’t see the white sand-bag,” said
Dudley.</p>

<p>“Listen to the nutlet!” laughed Elizabeth. “Why,
there is nothing <em>but</em> water to see, ’cause the bag is in
the boat. Here, hold this white clam-shell under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
water about a yard or two away from your nose and
then tell me if you can see it!”</p>

<p>Elizabeth handed the clam-shell to Edith who offered
to hold it for Dudley or Paul. Paul clamoured
for a trial and thus attracted Edith’s attention to him.
She had an idea then and there.</p>

<p>The clam-shell was held and Paul dove. The moment
he was near enough to her hand, Edith caught
hold of his head and held it under water just as he had
done to her a short time before.</p>

<p>Forgetting his predicament, Paul tried to scream
for help and a flood of water poured into his mouth.
Edith soon allowed her victim to come up again, but
he choked and coughed so with anger that every one
laughed at the case of “tit for tat.”</p>

<p>While this affray was going on, the watchers on the
rock saw Fred try in vain to empty the water out of
the canoe after righting it, so Mrs. Remington called
out:</p>

<p>“Better desist at present&mdash;there are plenty of days to
try again&mdash;Fred!”</p>

<p>Fred did not want to give in but the tide was running
down and he was nearly opposite the south end of
the island at the time, so Captain Ed helped to empty
the canoe and the lad paddled back to the float in a
disappointed frame of mind.</p>

<p>When the visitors were ready to leave, Miriam and
Trixie were invited to remain and visit Elizabeth for a
few days. So they gladly remained stretched out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the rush mats drying their long wet hair in the hot
sunshine.</p>

<p>“Say, mother, isn’t it past time for lunch?” called
Fred, as Mrs. Remington came from the float-stage
after seeing the guests off in their launch.</p>

<p>“Um&mdash;that’s what we all want to know,” added
Billy.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is, I’ll go up and see,” replied Mrs.
Remington, but the ringing of the bell just then caused
a stampede from the rocks.</p>

<p>The ravenous young folks fell upon the pyramids of
hot biscuits and clam-chowder as if there would never
be another mouthful of food that summer. After three
helpings to the soup and many, many slices of bread,
besides the biscuits and crackers, Fred warned them all.</p>

<p>“The flag is up!”</p>

<p>“Where?” questioned Miriam, innocently, whereupon
the initiated Islanders laughed hilariously.</p>

<p>“I see it!” cried Trixie, as she pointed to an American
flag draped over the fireplace of the room.</p>

<p>Again every one laughed, and Miriam thought she
knew what it was all about.</p>

<p>“What&mdash;tell us?” demanded the boys.</p>

<p>“It’s the same as F. H. B. Family hold back!”</p>

<p>She had guessed wrong so Billy offered to tell the
girls. “It means, ‘Save a place for dessert&mdash;it’s <em>something
good</em>!’”</p>

<p>“Well, who ever thought of that!” exclaimed Trixie.</p>

<p>“Oh, we read a story in a magazine so we adapted it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
for our own use. In the tale the folks had a flag
stuck on the caster in the centre of the table. If the
flag stood upright it was a sign that dessert was good,
but when the flag was down, it showed there was no
need to leave room unless one wanted to,” explained
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“How could any one see the flag if it was on the
centre caster under the table?” wondered Miriam.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Did you think I meant the brass roller
on the table leg?” laughed Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you?” returned Trixie.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington then explained. “Some people call
them cruets. They are a silver, or plated affair, with
revolving holders for bottles. In the holder are six
or seven holes in which glass bottles fit snugly. They
are filled with pepper, salt, oil, vinegar, catsup, mustard
or horseradish. The bottles are raised a few
inches above the table-top and when any one wants a
condiment the revolving holder is swung about until
the bottle in need comes opposite the one wishing to
use it.”</p>

<p>“Goodness! Did every one reach out and get the
bottle he or she wanted?” asked Trixie, sceptically.</p>

<p>“I saw a queer little thing like that for a doll’s
tea-set but I didn’t know what it was for,” added
Edith.</p>

<p>“It is like everything else&mdash;things deemed necessary
or fashionable to-day pass into the antiques of to-morrow,”
remarked Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
“Say there, mother! don’t shunt us off on a sidetrack
of antiques when we are maintaining that vacant
spot for dessert,” asserted Fred, vehemently.</p>

<p>“Where is the welcome dish, anyway?” added Billy.</p>

<p>“Patience&mdash;Mose will soon appear with it,” said his
mother.</p>

<p>Steps were heard shuffling towards the swing door
of the pantry then, and every eye watched the entrance
of Mose. He carried a deep covered pudding dish and
several tongues smacked in anticipation.</p>

<p>The dish was placed accurately in front of his
mistress before Mose ceremoniously removed the silver
cover.</p>

<p>“Ugh!” came from expectant Islanders and chairs
were pushed back from the table without delay.</p>

<p>“What is it?” wondered Miriam.</p>

<p>“Just some old bread-pudding!” scoffed Edith.</p>

<p>“Bread pudding is healthy, I’ve heard,” ventured
Trixie to be polite to her hostess.</p>

<p>“So are all nasty things to eat!” retorted Billy.</p>

<p>“We might give Trixie our portions, Billy,” suggested
Elizabeth, as she asked to be excused.</p>

<p>“Well, if no one wants this pudding I fear Mose
will have to eat it all by himself,” said Mrs. Remington,
laughingly.</p>

<p>“Serve you right, Mose, you know how we hate
bread-pudding,” added Fred.</p>

<p>Mose stood behind his mistress’ chair grinning but
now he replied to Fred’s remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
“Wha’fo’ yo’ all diden’ have dat flag down!”</p>

<p>Every one laughed but Billy, who had gone out by
the pantry. Before the laughter had ceased however,
he pushed in past the swinging door and carried aloft
a great blueberry pie.</p>

<p>Fred caught the dish from his brother and balanced
it upon his palms in imitation of a Japanese juggler.</p>

<p>“Friends and fellow Islanders! We have routed
the miser who guarded this treasure and now we place
this life-saving device before you all to help you recover
from the recent fatal disappointment. The question
now before the house is, ‘To be or not to be!’”</p>

<p>The pie was placed before Mrs. Remington who
laughed and looked at Mose for a verdict.</p>

<p>“It is to be, of course!” shouted Billy, hugging his
mother to show how much he loved her just then.</p>

<p>“How! How!” yelled the children so that the lady
of the house had to cover her ears.</p>

<p>“Ah wishes t’ offer a sugges’ion!” remonstrated
Mose.</p>

<p>“Silence while the proprietor of the pie speaks!”
called Fred, authoritatively.</p>

<p>“Ef yo’ each eats a bit o’ dat bread-puddin’ Ah says,
let each take a slab o’ my blueberry pie!”</p>

<p>“Done! Done!” promised the boys, and every one
sat down to swallow large chunks of the detestable
pudding.</p>

<p>“While I am cutting this pie I wish some one would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
explain why it was thought that a good dessert was
prepared for this noon,” said Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“How does any hungry boy know what is in the pantry?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, I’m sure,” replied his mother.</p>

<p>“By following his nose, of course! When a feller is
famished he naturally hangs around the kitchen.
That’s what we did and so we smelled something good.
By following the trail we saw the deep-dish pie cooling
on the pantry window-sill but we dared not snitch it
then ’cause Mose was right there, so we had to come
in and take our turn,” confessed Billy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington laughed as she cut the pie but one
or two slices were the fraction of an inch larger than
the others, hence the hot argument that instantly arose
to confound her carelessness.</p>

<p>Teeth and lips were well-stained a beautiful blue-black
and the downward track of juicy pie had left telltale
spots on the front of shirts and frocks before Billy
stood up and sighed. “I don’t see why it is that there
is always so little of a good thing! Now, look at that
bread-pudding&mdash;a great tub of a dish, and such a tiny
little pie!”</p>

<p>The others laughed and Mrs. Remington added,
“Well, as you had your pie this noon, there will be no
dessert to-night!”</p>

<p>“Say, let’s offer Mose a testimonial for that pie and
who knows but he may be flattered into baking another
for dinner,” suggested Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
With such a worthy object in view, the young folks
drew up a wonderful set of resolutions and presented it
in due form to Mose. Teddy, aged four, was chosen
as the courier while all of the others marched in line
behind the youngest of the family. As the signed vote
of thanks was presented to him, Mose laughed.</p>

<p>“Dis is once when yo’ all get lef’! Ha, ha, ha! When
yo’ mah say, ‘Mose, dis bread gotta be used’, Ah says,
‘Yes’m, but dis fam’bly won’t eat bread-pudding,
nohow!’</p>

<p>“Den she says, ‘Mek it fo’ an extry dish an’ serb it
fust, Mose, an’ d’ blue-berry pie kin be t’ tempter t’
make ’em eat d’ puddin’!’</p>

<p>“Ah wuz goin’ t’ do dat when Billy gits ahaid o’ me
an’ done bring dat pie in jes’ es ef it wuz so ordered!
Ha, ha, ha!”</p>

<p>“Then that pie was for luncheon after all?” cried
Billy.</p>

<p>“Shore thing!” grinned Mose.</p>

<p>“And didn’t you make anything for supper?” worried
Paul.</p>

<p>“Jes’ peep in dat po’ch cupboard!” ordered Mose.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! That means ice-cream,” shouted Billy,
for Mose always placed the ice-packed freezer out
on the back stoop where the melting ice could drain off
to the ground.</p>

<p>After an hour of rest, Fred called a class in First-Aids.</p>

<p>Ladders were placed against the bungalow roof and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
the Fireman’s Lift was practised&mdash;Dudley being the
willing victim who hung limp and helpless in a faint
when the brave fireman found him and carried him
down from the roof to safety.</p>

<p>Then the Shaefer method of resuscitation of a
drowning person was practised upon Edith. Poles
were then run through sweaters and an improvised
stretcher made for Paul who was supposed to have
been badly injured in a battle. Billy and Dudley were
the Red Cross men who carried the groaning soldier
away and unexpectedly dumped him out upon the
grass.</p>

<p>When serious practice had turned into a frolic,
Fred called them all to sit down and rest, but such
a thing was impossible for healthy active boys. However,
they were stretched out upon the flat rock when
Paul asked a question.</p>

<p>“Fred, how long do you think it will take me to
swim a hundred yards? By the end of the month,
do you think?”</p>

<p>“If you quit fooling and ’tend strictly to work you
may. But we have not tried to swim much before
this, as the water has been too cold. We can remain
in longer, however, as the weather grows warmer.”</p>

<p>“If we would warm up after bathing by running
and jumping we could swim in ice-water without
danger,” declared Billy.</p>

<p>“We might try that&mdash;and do the ‘Hop, step, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
jump,’ for a <em>coup</em> and see how it will warm us up after
bathing,” added Fred.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington overheard the boys planning and
she now interrupted. “I’ll tell you boys what you
might do! You know that bare rocky plateau on top
of the Island where the sun always shines so hot?
Well, take some sun-baths there after you come out of
the cold water. Take an old cot and a spare mattress
and leave it there if you like. Besides, you can always
use the canoe cushions. By getting tanned all
over you will harden and fortify your bodies so that
a little chill of the water will not affect you as it is apt
to do now.”</p>

<p>This was considered good advice and the boys carried
out the plan and resorted to the rock the very
next morning.</p>

<p>“In case any one of you should get the shivers after
the bath, run to the bungalow and have Mose give you
a cup of hot soup&mdash;it will warm you through at once,”
called Mrs. Remington, as the boys left the float-stage
where the others were talking.</p>

<p>That evening while every one sat about reading until
it came time for bed, Billy suddenly entered the living-room
dressed as Charlie Chaplin. He had not been
missed from the family party so the surprise was all the
more genuine. He had on a pair of Fred’s long
trousers, a black coat of his father’s, a gigantic pair of
old shoes from Mose’s wardrobe, and a cane found in
the hall-closet. He had cut a small piece of black fur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
from the rug and attached it to his upper lip with
a piece of spruce gum.</p>

<p>Billy was an excellent mimic and could appear most
serious upon occasion, and now he threw every one
into spasms of laughter by his mimicry of the famous
comedian. Before long, all of the audience wanted to
act too, so the bungalow living-room became a scene
for a motion picture play where fear, joy, sorrow and
crime were registered by villains, hero and heroine.</p>

<p>“Say, wouldn’t it be fun to have a character party,”
suggested Elizabeth, when every one had to stop and
rest for a time.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Let’s do it!” cried a number of eager
voices.</p>

<p>“Children, you <em>must</em> go to bed! Why, it is fully an
hour past the usual time,” reminded Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“But we will get together in the morning and plan
out some dandy costumes, shall we?” cried Billy, as
they all started for bed.</p>

<p>And that was how the idea started which developed
later into the Grand Masked Ball.</p>

<h2><a name="vi" id="vi"></a>CHAPTER SIX<br />
<small>THE PICNIC AT SPRUCE ISLAND</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">“</span>Y</span>O ho, ye Sunset Islanders!” called a voice from
the doorway of the bungalow, and there stood
the Captain from Isola Bella with a note in his hand.</p>

<p>“Oh Benton, you’re not going to take me home?”
cried Miriam, watching Mrs. Remington’s face
anxiously as she opened the letter.</p>

<p>“No indeed, Miriam&mdash;it is an invitation,” said Mrs.
Remington. “Listen, my children, and you shall hear
of a picnic planned on Spruce Island for to-morrow
if the day is fine. Uncle Bill says that the tide will
not be quite right&mdash;high in the middle of the day and
ebb all afternoon, but we can all go down in the
launch.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be great!” cried Paul.</p>

<p>“I think Uncle Bill’s a brick!” exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>“If there’s a cap full of wind I’m going to sail
down, mother, and add to my mileage for the sailing
<em>coup</em>,” added Fred, quick to take advantage of
such a good opportunity.</p>

<p>“Suppose you can’t sail back?” asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Then we can be towed back&mdash;if the worst comes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
the worst. Who wants to sail with me?” said Fred.</p>

<p>So many replied that they had to draw lots with
slips of paper and Paul and Dudley won the prize.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t that be fine!” cried Paul, dancing about
with the winning slip of paper waving over his head.</p>

<p>“Hurrah, I got a winner, too! You’ll let me help
sail her, won’t you, Fred?” begged Dudley.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll let you learn if you’ll do just as I say,”
replied Fred, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Cross my heart, I will,” said Dudley, solemnly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care if you do sail, Dud, ’cause Benton’s
goin’ to let <em>me</em> steer the Zeus,” bragged Billy,
nonchalantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Sonny, I’m going to prepare you for that
launch you told me you wanted to buy,” agreed the
Captain with whom Billy was a great favourite.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington smiled at the Captain’s reference
to the “phantom launch” of Billy’s and handed Benton
a note of acceptance for the picnic.</p>

<p>As the Captain backed to the door of the bungalow,
he remarked in farewell, “I must be goin’ across the
bay, now, to take an invitation to your uncle and
aunt.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose Mrs. Charlton will take me back home
with her to-night, so I may as well be packing my
suit-case,” grumbled Trixie, dolefully.</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose so! I believe Mrs. Charlton has
planned a motor trip for you,” added Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
“I wish Trixie could stay with us all summer,
mother,” sighed Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Well, we must have her over again very soon,
dear,” replied Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“Oh, I wish you would! But I ought to have a
better camp outfit&mdash;my checked skirt is the only suitable
article I really have for the boat or outdoor fun,”
said Trixie.</p>

<p>The entire party trooped down to see Captain Benton
off and while he embarked the supper bell rang
from the bungalow doorway. Then there was a race
on the course from the float-stage to the table. As
usual, when it was a question of eating, Paul came
in first.</p>

<p>That evening, the moonlight was so beautiful that
Fred proposed a row around the Island. Everybody
accepted without hesitation and the two boats were
soon gliding through the water in the silvery track of
the moon.</p>

<p>The merry voices of the young singers in the party
sounded far over the calm bay and roused Uncle
Bill’s mastiff. No doubt the dog heard and recognised
the voices of his little pals of the Island. The
baying of Nelson then brought the plaintive “baa-baas”
of the sheep on Islesboro and blended musically
with the singing.</p>

<p>“Say, let’s call to Nelse!” suggested Billy, about to
whistle when Miriam quickly stopped him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
“No, no! Nelson will surely try to swim over to
join us, you know!” cried Miriam.</p>

<p>“Did Nelse ever swim as far as this?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“You bet he did, the old rascal!” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“It was one day when Mamma and all of us from
Isola Bella came to a picnic over here and Nelson
was left alone. After he hunted everywhere for
some one to share his watch, he decided to follow
after us. We had all gone to the south end when we
heard a crashing through the bushes back of us. And
there stood old Nelse&mdash;all in, too, from the long swim
in the icy water,” explained Miriam.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! Nelson ought to have a Grand <em>coup</em>
for that!” laughed Dudley.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s why Papa doesn’t want him to try it
again,” added Miriam, seriously.</p>

<p>“Why&mdash;because he won a Grand <em>coup</em>?” teased
Billy.</p>

<p>“<em>Oh</em>, you know what I mean!” retorted Miriam,
while the others laughed merrily.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t the tide make the island a lot bigger when
it is low?” remarked Paul, looking curiously at the
shore line.</p>

<p>“Yes, it adds an acre or two to the area,” replied
Fred.</p>

<p>“Do you think the sky looks as if it would be a clear
day for the picnic?” now asked Dudley, anxiously,
peering at a cloud as large as his hand.</p>

<p>“Sure thing! But I think we ought to get back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
to camp and go to bed so we can get up bright and
early,” advised Fred.</p>

<p>So without further demur the boats were turned
toward the float and the Islanders were soon climbing
the path to the tents.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, came a clarion call that
hastened the toilettes of the occupants of tents and
bungalow&mdash;“Rouse ye Britons, Rouse ye Slaves!”</p>

<p>Billy sprang out of bed and waved his hand in token
of obedience, as he saw his mother stand calling
through the megaphone.</p>

<p>“Hurry up now, we’ve got a lot to do before we’re
ready for the picnic,” advised Fred, pulling Paul out
of his cot.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a hurried meal that morning as
every one was busily engaged in getting everything
needed to make the picnic at Spruce Island a success.
Elizabeth and Fred were packing the big hamper with
good things while Billy and Dudley were helping Mose
and Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>The wheel-barrow had been loaded three times and
the picnic stuff transported from the commissary department
of the bungalow to the float-stage before all
was ready and waiting for the boat.</p>

<p>At the last moment Mrs. Remington saw Edith
standing looking about for any forgotten item. Suddenly
she called to the child.</p>

<p>“Oh, Edith! Don’t forget the nature books! You
know Spruce Island is rich in specimens of wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
flowers and you Woodcrafters will want to complete
your lists of fifty varieties.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I almost forgot that! And I only have twenty
more to get for my <em>coup</em> for wild flowers,” cried
Edith, running indoors.</p>

<p>“Anna, are you quite sure we packed enough sandwiches?”
asked Mrs. Remington, turning to the governess
as she came from the house.</p>

<p>Anna laughed. “If the heaped-up loads I saw taken
by slow freight via the wheel-barrow route a few
moments ago are all eatables, I should say we could
feed the starving Belgians for a week, at least!”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, Anna, you know how our children <em>eat</em>
and then there will be the Rosemary folks and all of
the Isola Bella people, too!” reminded Mrs. Remington,
seriously.</p>

<p>“Even so, won’t they bring hampers?” returned
Anna.</p>

<p>“Well, Aunt Miriam is bringing a large freezer of
ice-cream and Aunt Edith said she would bake two
large cakes, but I haven’t the slightest idea of what
else they may bring.”</p>

<p>“Judging from past picnics, I should guarantee that
each one of the three families will take enough to
last all summer,” remarked Anna, smilingly.</p>

<p>“Maybe, but it also is a fact that not a crumb is ever
found to carry back home or throw to the fish!”</p>

<p>At this moment Fred appeared on the scene with a
plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
“Mother, Paul and Dud and I want to sail to the
Island in the dory. You see, I want to win my sailing
<em>coup</em> for one hundred and fifty miles this summer,
and this opportunity is a good one.”</p>

<p>“But the tide is against you, Fred,” objected his
mother.</p>

<p>“That won’t matter so much as there is a nice stiff
breeze from the northwest and the boys have agreed
to be good.”</p>

<p>“Well, all right, then,” complied his mother.</p>

<p>By ten-thirty the boys had started and the others
were all ready and waiting impatiently for the first
peep at the Zeus which was to take them to Spruce
Island.</p>

<p>“What a boatful! And still more to come,”
laughed Billy, as he watched Captain Benton carefully
manipulate the Zeus to bring it alongside the
float.</p>

<p>“Why, where’s Aunt Miriam and Uncle Bill?” cried
Edith, missing them from the group in the Zeus.</p>

<p>“The ice-cream was not quite finished and so Papa
sent to ask the Captain to stop again for them on
the way down,” explained Miriam.</p>

<p>Captain Ed had just started the power-dory that
was to carry the commissary and Mose to Spruce
Island, when Billy, watching, gave vent to a loud sigh.</p>

<p>“What’s troublin’ you, sonny?” asked the Captain.</p>

<p>“Ah gee! I wish I had a launch and you know as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
well as I where there’s a peach I could get at a bargain!”</p>

<p>“Maybe, if you’re a good boy something will happen
about the time of your birthday,” hinted Mrs.
Remington.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother! I’d be willing to go without my allowance
and add all my Christmas money to it, too, if I
could have that launch now!” exclaimed Billy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, never mind now, but try to behave and earn
the launch that way,” advised his mother.</p>

<p>Arrived at Isola Bella the mariners found Uncle
Bill making a great to-do about moving the heavy ice-cream
freezer over on the wharf. Aunt Miriam and
two lady visitors stood giving him superfluous advice
as he did things his own way, after all.</p>

<p>After the freezer was safely shipped, a large hamper
of goodies followed, and then the ladies were assisted
aboard.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! We’re off at last!” cried Uncle Bill,
as they rounded the south end of Isola Bella.</p>

<p>“And I can see the Orion with all on board! Blow
the whistle, Billy, and salute them,” added Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>An answering whistle came from Uncle Tom, and
soon his launch carrying the second party slipped
along after the Zeus on its way to Spruce Island.</p>

<p>“How about a chantey!” shouted Uncle Bill, for he
had been very quiet for at least two minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Without a second’s delay, Billy started up and the
rest joined in the song.</p>

<p>Having arrived at Spruce Island, a brigade was
formed to carry boxes, hampers, and wraps from the
boats to the picnic spot in the shade of a clump of firs.</p>

<p>The younger element in the party wanted to start
at once on an exploration of the island, which contained
nearly two hundred acres, thickly wooded with
fir trees and white birch overhanging the rocky bluffs
of the shore.</p>

<p>“See here, boys, if you go alone on this quest, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
must promise to stick together. We have never been
all over the island and there may be danger spots that
we know nothing of, you see. With a crowd there is
comparative safety, but should one of you straggle
away and get into trouble it might be difficult to help,”
admonished Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>The very seriousness of the habitually jolly man
made an impression on the boys so that Fred promised
for all of them. “And we’ll be all right, folks, never
fear,” added he.</p>

<p>“I don’t see why we girls can’t go with you,” pouted
Trixie.</p>

<p>“That isn’t it, but I really do not approve of the
boys going alone, to say nothing of you girls going
too!” remonstrated Aunt Miriam.</p>

<p>The boys made quick work of getting away for fear
of being called back by one of the troubled mothers
while the girls were soon engaged in finding new
specimens of flowers for their books.</p>

<p>“If we gather them now we can identify and arrange
them after lunch this noon,” suggested Elizabeth.</p>

<p>The boys had covered many acres of the island and
were feeling like genuine explorers when Billy suddenly
spied a fish-hawk’s nest high up in a tall spruce.</p>

<p>“Great Scott, Bill! <em>What</em> a chance to get a snapshot
of that osprey’s nest,” called Fred.</p>

<p>“It’s lucky that I brought my kodak, isn’t it?”
added Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
“The tree looks kind of risky to climb,” ventured
Dudley.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I can climb it easy enough,” boasted Billy.</p>

<p>“Bill’s climbed higher and worse trees than this
one,” added Fred.</p>

<p>“Well, seein’ he’s the best climber in the bunch I’ll
let him use my kodak if he wants to shinny up and
try for a close-up picture,” offered Paul.</p>

<p>“That’ll be great! and I can add another one to my
list of wild-bird photographs,” said Billy, delightedly.</p>

<p>“For me too,” said Paul.</p>

<p>“Why, no, it won’t count for you unless you climb
up and get it,” remonstrated Dudley.</p>

<p>An argument followed that made Paul sulky but
Billy paid little attention to him as he took the kodak
and climbed up the giant spruce.</p>

<p>There was a thick tangle of undergrowth all about
the tree and the boys had had to break through this
before reaching the spruce. So intent were Fred and
Dudley in watching Billy go higher and ever higher,
that they failed to note Paul’s absence.</p>

<p>Paul, with his impatient and stubborn nature, felt
so piqued at the idea of not being able to claim the
coup after offering the use of his kodak, started away
from the boys in a huff. The boys never dreamed of
his anger or envy over the <em>coup</em> winning so did not
trouble to look over or beyond the jungle of brush.
While Paul, be it said to his credit, forgot all about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Uncle Bill’s admonition and the promise made not to
wander away from the others.</p>

<p>He finally reached a small promontory of land that
jutted out into the sea. As he walked out on the upthrust,
a white strip of sandy beach was found to be
lying snugly at the bottom of the bluff. About a hundred
feet across from the place where the boy stood,
another large finger of high-land ran out from the
shore actually making a secluded little cove of the
beach.</p>

<p>“My, what a dandy little place for a swim! I can
undress down between these two high rocks and have
a dip, then get back into my clothes again before
Billy gets through with that nest!” said Paul to himself
as he slid down the steep bank to the beach.</p>

<p>Once on the smooth sand the boy looked about. He
was well-screened all right, and not a thing could he
see beyond the high banks behind him.</p>

<p>“Just like a bath-house. Two rock walls, with
some trees right behind and a peachy beach in front!
No one’d ever dream of finding sand on this island of
rocks and fir-grown boulders,” remarked Paul to himself,
as he started to walk to the water’s edge.</p>

<p>“I’ll just see how far out this little sand strip runs&mdash;it
may stop short just beyond and then drop down
suddenly.”</p>

<p>As Paul bent over the sparkling water the better to
scan the distance the sand ran out under the waves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
he felt himself slowly sinking down to his ankles in the
sand.</p>

<p>“Huh! This is funny. Never felt anything like it
before,” murmured he, chuckling at the queer sensation
of being sucked down.</p>

<p>By the time his legs were in to the shins, he started
to wonder seriously, not yet dreaming of danger,
however.</p>

<p>Not entirely liking the grip the sand seemed to have
taken on his feet, Paul tried to back away but found
he could not tear his feet out of its clutch.</p>

<p>“Let go! Let me get out, I say!” growled Paul to
the quicksand, as he twisted and struggled to climb
out of the mire.</p>

<p>The boy had not enough experience to know what to
do in this emergency and being too far away from
the other boys to be seen by them, he felt that he must
manage to get free of the quagmire that was drawing
him in deeper every moment.</p>

<p>By the time he had sunk to the calves he was thoroughly
frightened and endeavoured wildly to throw
himself out of the engulfing sand. The more he
struggled and squirmed the quicker he sank and then,
desperate with his danger and horror, he screamed at
the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>He gazed frantically about, but the only sign of
habitation was a deserted-looking camp some distance
away on the bluff.</p>

<p>Again Paul yelled “Help! Help! Help!” and ended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
in a terrific cry that curdled the blood in Billy’s veins
just as he was about to push the button in the kodak.</p>

<p>“What’s that yell, Bill?” called Fred from below.</p>

<p>Frightened Billy looked around carefully and
located a human speck down near the water. From
the manner in which it was tossing about its arms it
seemed to be in dire need of help.</p>

<p>None of the boys were aware of Paul’s desertion
but expected to find him fooling with bugs or flowers
on the other side of the brush. So, Billy thought
some one unknown to them needed help.</p>

<p>“Some one’s having a nasty time over there near
the water&mdash;I don’t know who or what is wrong, but
I can make out that whoever it is wants help. Hustle
over and see, Fred!” called Billy.</p>

<p>“Where&mdash;which way and direction?” shouted Fred,
looking up at Billy.</p>

<p>“Off in that direction&mdash;straight through that opening
of the firs!” came down from Billy, who had
started to descend the moment he took the bearings.</p>

<p>“We’ll run ahead, you follow, Bill!” called Fred,
turning to tell Dudley and Paul to come with him.</p>

<p>“Where’s Paul?” cried he, suddenly missing the
boy.</p>

<p>“Wh-hy-I don’t know. I was so busy watching
Billy I didn’t see him leave us,” replied Dudley, frightened
and running after Fred as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>Billy reached the ground and started to tear after
the other boys when he heard the familiar whistle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
generally given as a signal from Uncle Bill when he
was in search of any one.</p>

<p>Billy signalled in return and soon Uncle Bill came
from the fir-woods and crossed the small clearing that
lay between the firs and the spruce where the hawk’s
nest was located.</p>

<p>“Hurry&mdash;come with me and help!” cried Billy,
catching hold of his uncle’s hand before anything
could be said.</p>

<p>On the way he breathlessly explained what he had
seen from the tree-top, and where Fred and Dudley
had gone.</p>

<p>“Must be a quicksand. If all you boys are O. K.
who can it be? I thought no one was on the island
besides ourselves?” cried Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>“I saw a sort of a hut near there when I was up
in the tree!” added Billy.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is some one from the hut; but then they
ought to know of the danger I should think! Anyway
we ought to have a rope to throw,” said Uncle
Bill now thoroughly anxious, dragging his nephew
along to keep up with his running strides.</p>

<p>“I’ll run over to the camp and see if I can find a
line or rope,” said Billy, as they reached the edge of
the grove near the bluff.</p>

<p>“Yes, and if any one lives there get them to come
and help with a board or plank!”</p>

<p>Billy ran along the edge of the bluff toward the
camp he could see some distance away, while Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Bill came out to the sheltered strip of beach where he
saw Fred and Dudley striving to save Paul’s life.</p>

<p>It needed but a glance to make the whole situation
clear, and in wild leaps the man reached the frantic
group on the sand.</p>

<p>“Keep still, don’t move!” shouted Fred to the struggling
Paul.</p>

<p>“The more you squirm and fight the deeper you
go!” added Dudley, as Uncle Bill ran up behind them.</p>

<p>Fred was lying on his stomach trying to shove an
old fence rail out to the boy. As he carefully guided
it so that the end of the rail would slide over the sand
and possibly be worked under the arm of the victim,
he encouraged Paul with advice.</p>

<p>“When this rail comes near you, try to get your arm
over it so it can be used as a brace for you. Then,
I’ll try to work another out for your other arm.”</p>

<p>“Here, Fred, let me do that job while Dud and you
run and get some more rails wherever you found
these,” cried the welcome voice of Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>Both boys showed signs of great relief and confidence
as they gave place to the man, and started for
the rails of an old fence they had found while crossing
the clearing near the bluff.</p>

<p>Meantime, Billy reached the camp but found no one
there. It appeared to be a deserted fisherman’s hut
but some old rope still hung coiled upon a hook driven
in the side of the door-post.</p>

<p>When he reached the spot where Uncle Bill was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
working to help Paul, Billy was shocked to recognise
the victim.</p>

<p>Fred and Uncle Bill managed to worm the rails out
so that Paul slid his arms up over them and this acted
as a <a name="resistible" id="resistible"></a><ins title="Original has resistable">resistible</ins> brace against the suction of the mire.
Then, with practised hand the coil of rope was flung
and as it fell it formed a loop over Paul’s head.</p>

<p>“Now, work that noose down over your shoulders,
and when both arms are over it give the word so I can
pull you out,” ordered Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>Once more on terra firma Paul was congratulated
at his narrow escape but the pallor of his face was
sufficient punishment then, so that Uncle Bill refrained
from scolding him.</p>

<p>“The next thing for us to do is to scrape Paul. We
ought to get him over to Mose where he can undress
and wrap himself in a shawl until this mire is washed
from his clothes,” said Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>“We must keep this a secret from the girls, you
know,” warned Fred.</p>

<p>“If they smell a rat we’ll say Paul slipped into a
pool of mire, which is the truth,” laughed Dudley.</p>

<p>“I think some one ought to set up a danger sign at
that awful spot,” said Paul, still shivering at the
thought of it.</p>

<p>“Yes, Paul’s right. We’ll go back afterwards and
fix up some sort of warning for others,” approved
Fred.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you how! When we go back for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
picture of the fish-hawk’s nest this afternoon, we can
sneak down and stick up that Turkey red cushion top
from the launch. That will mean danger, you know,”
suggested Billy.</p>

<p>“And maybe you can find a can of paint or some
other stuff at that shack so I can mark a warning on
the boulder of rock alongside of the sand,” added
Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>Paul and his rescuers reached Mose’s camp and were
fortunate enough to find everybody gone on a flower
quest. Mose alone kept solitary vigil of the clam-chowder
cooking over a good camp-fire. In a moment,
he was eager to help poor Paul in his “mire”
need.</p>

<p>“Heah, Chile, tak’ dese two sweaters an’ use ’em fo’
a go’fing costume. Clim’ inta th’ sleeves ov one
sweater wid yur feet an’ pull de’ odder down obber yo’
haid. Strap bof’ togedder about yo’ middle wid’da
rope&mdash;lik’ dat, now!” And Mose assisted Paul in
dressing as he advised.</p>

<p>When the boy emerged from back of the bushes
where he and his valet had retired, the other boys
laughed at the sight the sweaters made of Paul.</p>

<p>Mose gathered up the miry clothes and started in
to scrape them as clean as possible before washing
them.</p>

<p>“Say, Bo, yo’ don’ ever expec’ t’ wear deses again,
do yo’?” questioned he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
“Can’t they be washed clean?” wondered Paul,
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Ah kin wash ’em but dis clam-mud ain’t neber goin’
t’ let go fer good! One thing sure, dough, it’ll mek’
th’ coat thicker an’ warmer fo’ nex’ winter!” grinned
Mose.</p>

<p>“Oh, go ’long, Mose, we all know you’re foolin’!”
laughed Billy, leading Paul away from the teasing
cook.</p>

<h2><a name="vii" id="vii"></a>CHAPTER SEVEN<br/>
<small>FURTHER ADVENTURES AT SPRUCE ISLAND</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">B</span>EFORE Mose had quite finished washing out the
muddy clothes the flower hunters returned. Elizabeth
was highly elated because she had found enough
new varieties to complete her list of fifty for the Wild-Flower
<em>coup</em>, while Miriam’s and Edith’s lists had
reached thirty different kinds.</p>

<p>As the girls ran over to the group of boys to tell
them about their successful hunt, Trixie stood still
and gasped. The others turned to look in the direction
that she was staring and a burst of merriment
sounded from them all.</p>

<p>“Good gracious, Paul! Where did you find the
upsey-downsey suit of clothes&mdash;are you masquerading?”
cried Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Paul mumbled but looked annoyed and uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t he look like one of those double-headed
dolls? You hold them one way and they are
Mammys, and you turn them up the other way and
they are something else,” said Trixie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
“What ever put it into your head to dress that way,
Paul?” persisted Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, he thought you girls would like
clams on the half-shell so he found a spot where he
tried digging. But he dug so deep while trying to
catch a big fat juicy clam, that he fell into the hole and
pulled the hole in after him. We had all we could do
to pull him out again, but when he finally did come
out, Lo! he pulled the hole out too!” explained the
irrepressible Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>“So, that’s why Mose is giving his clothes a Turkish
bath,” giggled Billy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington and Mrs. Farwell looked hard at
Uncle Bill but forbore saying more at that time.</p>

<p>Mose soon completed the task given him and then
sounded a tin pan for the call to luncheon. A grand
scramble ensued and there was much confusion and
advice before every one was comfortably settled on
cushions and rugs about a large cloth spread out upon
the grass.</p>

<p>The three hostesses had been very busy unpacking
and arranging the contents of hampers and boxes but
now that the result of their efforts and work was
finished the hungry picnicers enjoyed the wonderful
meal thoroughly and the viands disappeared like magic.</p>

<p>Wide and well worn was the trail made by Mose
as he tracked back and forth from famished eaters
to the chowder kettle and when Billy called for a
fourth bowl of the delicious soup, the distracted chef<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
turned the pot upside down in silence to prove that
not a drop remained therein.</p>

<p>Directly after luncheon, Uncle Bill proposed a hike
around the island stopping at the tall spruce tree to
retake the snap-shot of the hawk’s nest and also to
place a signal on the beach of quicksand.</p>

<p>“Ah! Now I know how Paul delved for that
clam!” murmured Mrs. Remington, nodding her head
wisely.</p>

<p>“Oh, by the way! maybe Billy has requisitioned too
much chowder to be in trim to climb that tree!” said
Uncle Bill quietly, the moment he recognised the
blunder he had made.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you don’t, Bill!” laughed Mrs. Farwell.
“You’re fairly caught this time and we demand knowledge
of that clam-digging feat!”</p>

<p>However, Uncle Bill was not to be caught napping
again, so he began a long, tiresome story of clam-digging
until every one told him to “cut it short!”</p>

<p>Having succeeded in taking a picture of the fish-hawk’s
nest and rigging up the red banner for a signal
to unwary hikers, as well as painting a warning on the
front face of the rock in white lead, the entire crowd
continued the hike over the island.</p>

<p>After many adventures they came to a small beach
at the north end of the island where the winter storms
washed ashore all sorts of debris. Paul spied a gleaming
white section of a skeleton and he ran excitedly
over calling as he went:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
“Come on, boys! See what I’ve found!”</p>

<p>The others followed and soon were examining a
number of vertebra of a whale.</p>

<p>“By the Great Horn Spoon! Is a remnant of that
old whale here yet!” cried Uncle Bill, in surprise.</p>

<p>“What old whale&mdash;do tell us the story!” begged
Billy, scenting an exciting adventure of Uncle Bill’s
youth.</p>

<p>“Well, when I was about your age, my brother and
I took a sail one day and landed for lunch at this
island. We intended to spend the day fishing for cod
and then start home about sunset. Just about the
time we were ready for lunch, the wind veered and
brought the most dreadful odour to our nostrils.</p>

<p>“We looked at each other, while reaching the same
conclusion&mdash;something unusual had been washed
ashore!</p>

<p>“Say, Bill, folks say ‘follow your nose’&mdash;shall we?”
asked my brother.</p>

<p>“Sure thing&mdash;come on!” said I, and we ran down to
this beach and right here we came upon a young whale
which yet was ancient of days!</p>

<p>“Even in death the strength of the whale was more
than our lusty powers of resistance so we both returned
to that lunch minus an appetite. The fire was
smothered and we sadly resumed our cod-fishing, but
strange to say, it had lost its zest for us and the boat
seemed very wobbly. We returned home quite early
that day and took relief in a mad game of tennis.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
That evening we felt better and could partake of slight
nourishment!”</p>

<p>Every one laughed at Uncle Bill’s experience and
Dudley made a suggestion. “Let’s take home the
vertebra for souvenirs!”</p>

<p>“It won’t have the same effect now as it had years
ago, that’s certain,” said Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>So each boy loaded himself with the whitened bones
of the whale while the elders slowly retraced their
steps. At the clearing where the picnic was held,
Mose was found taking advantage of the peace by enjoying
a well-earned snooze.</p>

<p>The chef was roused by the noise made by the returning
explorers and Billy eagerly showed him the
souvenirs.</p>

<p>“Whale bones, Mose&mdash;the same one Uncle Bill
found when he was a boy.”</p>

<p>“What! Whalebones! Yo’ don’ mean t’ tell me
dat dem things is what dey puts in ladies co&mdash;yo’
know, dat&mdash;dat&mdash;well, yo’ all knows what Ah means!
Dem articles what d’ ladies wear t’ mek ’em look
slim,” delicately hinted Mose.</p>

<p>Every one ha-haed at the manner of Mose’s questioning,
and Uncle Bill explained that the whalebone
of commerce and corsets came from the rows of
screen plates that are so arranged in a whale’s mouth
that all of his food is strained out from his sea-water
soup.</p>

<p>“Jus’ lak’ es how it woul’ be ef yo’ took a mouf-ful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
ov chowder en’ shet yer teeth t’ keep in d’ clams whiles
yo’ squirt out all d’ water, eh?” asked Mose, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Just so, only more so!” laughed Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>After a light supper on the picnic grounds, haste
was made to embark. The tide was ebbing and there
was no wind so the dory was filled with the boxes and
baskets and towed behind the launch.</p>

<p>As the mariners came out from the shadow of the
overhanging bluffs of Spruce Island the moon, still in
its last quarter, shone silvery white in the heavens
and the stars sparkled with unusual brightness. The
Woodcrafters gazed at the blue dome overhead, and
started talking about the constellations.</p>

<p>“Who can show me where to find the Pole Star?”
then asked Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>Instantly many voices replied to this question.</p>

<p>“Paul, now’s your chance to point out the four
constellations you boasted about when that last tassel
was cut from your badge,” teased Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>“I will,” returned Paul. “The Pole Star’s in the
Little Bear, and there’s the Dipper, or Big Bear. Way
over in the west is Arcturus&mdash;I know him by the big
star, see? Then, that one up there in the northeast
is Cassiopaeia&mdash;it looks just like a ‘W.’ That makes
four!”</p>

<p>“Good for you! Now, who else can name any?”
said Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>“I can!” cried Elizabeth. “Directly over our heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
you will find Vega, in Lyra. And&mdash;oh, Paul, you
forgot to mention Orion in your’s!”</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! That’s one on you, Elizabeth, because
you can’t see Orion until early morning up here,”
laughed Fred.</p>

<p>“Why there are the Pleiades and Orion is near
them,” argued Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“But those <em>aren’t</em> the Pleiades, although I’ll admit
it looks like them,” protested her brother. “That’s
Job’s Coffin.”</p>

<p>“Well, I never! I’ve always said they were the
Pleiades even though I thought they appeared a bit
strange to me,” said the surprised girl.</p>

<p>“What are those stars near Job’s Coffin?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p>“That is Aquilla,” answered Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“Now let me get these down straight,” came from
Billy. “First, that ‘W’ is Cassiopaeia. Next to her&mdash;what
are those four big stars like a square?”</p>

<p>“It is called the Great Square of Pegasus,” replied
Mrs. Remington. “Then comes Aquilla and Job’s
Coffin, and above us you find Lyra.”</p>

<p>“Look! What is that large star in the northeast&mdash;it
is low down on the horizon but it is rising fast?”
cried Dudley.</p>

<p>Every one turned to gaze at the beautiful twinkling
star that seemed to sway in the sky. In fact Billy
denied it was a star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
“Any one can see with half an eye that that’s a
fire-balloon!” argued he.</p>

<p>However, it proved itself to be a star and finally,
Mrs. Remington and Fred identified it as Capella and
the atmospheric conditions near the horizon accounted
for its gyrations.</p>

<p>“But, mother, it is moving <em>east</em>!” cried Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> a fire-balloon, ’cause no star travels that way,”
added Billy.</p>

<p>Here Uncle Bill offered an explanation of the
marvel.</p>

<p>“It’s a star, all right, Billy, and it really is moving
east to us because we are so far north that we see it
below what is ordinarily the horizon! Watch carefully
now, and soon you will see it move west and behave
as all other well-trained stars do.”</p>

<p>This proved to be so and before the party quite
reached home Capella had risen high in the heavens to
join the orderly procession of westward moving stars.</p>

<p>“Do any of you know the Algonquin name for the
Big Dipper?” asked Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>Aunt Miriam demonstrated her knowledge of the
zodiac at this point and told the story of Ojeeg-Annung,
the Fisher Star.</p>

<p>“Ojeeg-Annung was a mighty hunter&mdash;he lived with
his wife and little son on the shores of a great lake.
They always had plenty to eat because Ojeeg was so
skilful in the chase. But at that time it was always
winter in the land&mdash;the sky people kept the Birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
of Summer shut up in cages in the Fields of Heaven.</p>

<p>“The little son complained of the continual cold,
especially when his hands were stiff and aching so that
he could not use his bow and arrow on the squirrels
and rabbits.</p>

<p>“One day when he cried with the cold, a squirrel
hopped up and told him, ‘Keep on crying and complaining
no matter what your parents offer you for
consolation, and at last your father, who is a magician,
will promise you anything you want if you will only
stop crying. Then ask him to make Summer in the
land!’</p>

<p>“The boy followed the squirrel’s advice and it happened
as he said it would.</p>

<p>“Ojeeg called all his fellow-chiefs together and they
made strong medicine and started off to climb to
Heaven.</p>

<p>“Finally they reached the top of a high mountain
and from there they could jump into heaven, by breaking
through the celestial floor.</p>

<p>“Before the sky-people could stop them, Ojeeg had
cut open the cages and freed the Birds of Summer.
They flew quickly down through the hole in heaven
and so we now have summer and warmth and flowers.</p>

<p>“Poor Ojeeg was overtaken by the sky-men and,
although he changed himself into his totem animal,
the fisher, he died from an arrow-head in the tip of his
tail&mdash;the only spot that was vulnerable. As he died,
he exclaimed: ‘I am satisfied to die because I have done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
such good, not only to my son but to all who come
hereafter.’</p>

<p>“There he is in the sky as a remembrance. What
we call the ‘Dipper’s Handle,’ the Indians call Ojeeg’s
long tail with the arrow sticking in the end.”</p>

<p>“What is the fisher like?” questioned Paul.</p>

<p>“It’s like an otter or a sable or a marten,” replied
Billy, the hunter.</p>

<p>“This marten story makes six different names I have
heard the Dipper go by, and I suppose there really are
others,” remarked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Six!” exclaimed Paul in surprise. “What are they
besides the Bear and the Dipper and this Fisher
Ojeeg?”</p>

<p>“Why, there are the Seven Plough Oxen, The Seven
Rishis, or Wise Men, and the Persian Heft Aurang or
Seven Thrones,” explained Elizabeth, the lover of
poetry and romance.</p>

<p>But the stars were soon forgotten after the Woodcrafters
landed and wearily sought their cots. A full
and happy day in the open made most of them sleepy
and glad to stretch out for the night.</p>

<h2><a name="viii" id="viii"></a>CHAPTER EIGHT<br />
<small>THE CRUISE TO CASTINE</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">“</span>M</span>OTHER, if we’re to have that masked ball that
all of you were talking about, it ought to be
given this week so’s to have Uncle Bill with us. You
see, he starts back to the city next week,” said Fred,
one morning soon after the picnic.</p>

<p>“Aunt Miriam and I were discussing that very
thing last night and we have decided to hold it in
Fudge Attic, at Isola Bella, some night this week.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t you determined upon any special night?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p>“As far as we can tell now, it will be Friday.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth had entered the room as they were speaking,
and stood holding a note the Captain had brought
her from Isola Bella. At her mother’s words she
smiled delightedly.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is just fine, ’cause Miriam has invited
Trixie and me to visit her for a few days this week.”</p>

<p>She handed her mother the note and waited until the
verdict was given. Of course, Elizabeth knew she
would be permitted to go but she had no thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
accepting, or planning for the visit without her
mother’s knowledge and consent.</p>

<p>“Be sure and take everything you may need for the
ball. If your suit-case isn’t large enough to hold
what you will need let Anna find you a suit-box for the
costume,” advised her mother.</p>

<p>“I’ll sail you over if you like, Elizabeth,” offered
Fred. “I’ve only done half of my hundred and fifty
miles for the sailing <em>coup</em> and I want to get in as much
as I can every day.”</p>

<p>Billy sauntered in at this juncture wondering where
his big brother could be.</p>

<p>“What’s up&mdash;Eliza going away?” he queried, hearing
Fred’s offer and his sister’s smiling acceptance.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington told him about the invitation and
Billy chuckled. “That’s good! Then you won’t be
here to see how we are going to be togged out for the
ball, and Trix and Miriam won’t have any one to tell
them who we are.”</p>

<p>Turning to his brother after having delivered this
speech, Billy added, “Say, can’t you let me take the
sail with you?”</p>

<p>“Sure&mdash;if you want to come.”</p>

<p>“Boys, why don’t both of you take a cruise and cover
a lot of ground at one time&mdash;I mean a lot of water in
one day!” suggested Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“Oh, mother, can we?” cried Billy.</p>

<p>“I’d like to, if you think it’s all right, mother,” added
Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
“If the weather is good and you make careful
plans I see nothing to hinder your trying it,” smiled
Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“Bully for you, mother dear! Fred, when can we
start!” shouted Billy, tossing his cap up to the ceiling.</p>

<p>“We can start to-morrow; Captain Ed says we are
in for a good spell of fine weather now,” replied Fred.</p>

<p>So as soon as the two boys returned from escorting
their sister to Isola Bella, they began preparing for the
cruise. The kindly Captain helped with the outfitting
of the little dory, and remarked that if they got an
early start in the morning they could have the flood-tide
to help them up the bay and then have all of the
ebb to come back on.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep a lookout about sunset and if the wind
flushes out, I’ll come after you with the launch,” concluded
he.</p>

<p>Mose willingly agreed to cook an early breakfast
for the two boys and he also tipped a wink to Billy
to come to the pantry and take a look in the cake-box.</p>

<p>Billy needed no second invitation and when he beheld
the delicious-looking cake reposing there for
appreciative cannibals, he sighed and asked, “Oh,
Mose! That for us!”</p>

<p>“Ef yo’ don’ say nuffin about it! Ah’m gwine t’
see dat he is tenderly wrapped up an’ shet away in a
box fo’ you’-all. But don’ go an’ get Pore Mose
in bad at supper t’night when they ain’t no dessert&mdash;onny
preserves!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
And that evening a number of those seated about
the supper-table noted how obediently Billy ate his
dish of prunes. Paul grumbled and said he hated
prunes and Dudley pushed back his plate full with a
wry face. Both boys then looked for some other
dessert but looked in vain!</p>

<p>“Prunes are awful good for one, aren’t they,
mother? We ought to eat plenty of prunes to be
healthy!” said Billy, virtuously.</p>

<p>Paul and Dudley stared at their chum in amazement.</p>

<p>“Humph! Some folks get good all of a sudden!”
sniffed Paul.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington had to control her face behind her
napkin, and to change the subject, she said: “Where
have you decided to go on your cruise to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Up to Castine and back again,” replied Billy.</p>

<p>“We expect to start about seven in the morning,”
added Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>can’t</em> we go with you?” cried Dudley, coaxingly.</p>

<p>“No indeed!” answered Mrs. Remington, decidedly.
“You know nothing about sailing, and the dory is too
small for a day’s sail for more than two people.”</p>

<p>The two youngsters were inclined to dispute this
decision but Fred cut short their grumbling by offering
a salve in form of an invitation to spend the day
on Captain Ed’s farm. The Captain lived on the
mainland and made periodical trips across the bay to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
bring back butter and eggs from his farm. This idea
of going with the Captain pleased Paul and Dudley
so that they went to bed in an amicable frame of
mind.</p>

<p>Early the next morning every one was up to see the
boys off on the cruise, and breakfast was eaten in
much excitement. It was a perfect day that seemed
made to order for the sailors. A light southerly wind
was blowing and soon the tide would begin to flow
and that would help them along materially.</p>

<p>Paul and Dudley, still yearning for the joys of a
cruise watched the dory leave the float-stage and then
they ran to the north end of the island just to see the
last of the little craft and the two boys they so heartily
envied that morning.</p>

<p>But no time was wasted in vain regrets when once
the dory was out of sight. The two boys hurried
back to the float to wait for Captain Ed who was to
carry them away for a glorious day on his farm.</p>

<p>On the way over to the mainland, the Captain said:
“I’ve got a young colt that needs a brave broncho
buster to ride him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Captain! let me try and ride it, will you?”
cried Paul.</p>

<p>“I can ride better’n Paul, Captain!” urged Dudley.</p>

<p>“No you can’t, neither! Ah now, Captain, <em>please</em>
let me ride her?”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s young and gentle all right, but full of
fire&mdash;like most young things. So I don’t see any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
objection to both of you boys riding her if you’re
careful.”</p>

<p>“And Paul, we’ll draw lots for the first ride!”</p>

<p>“The colt is a great pet and she may show a little
fear of you two Indians at first, but she’ll get used
to you if you give her some sugar,” advised the
Captain.</p>

<p>It was a scant mile’s walk from the Cove to the
farm but a friendly neighbour’s “jigger” was found
going their way, and the three had a lift as far as the
cross-roads.</p>

<p>“Did you ever see such a funny axle&mdash;it’s got a
broken back!” exclaimed Paul, curiously.</p>

<p>“It looks to me more like a crankshaft,” said
Dudley.</p>

<p>“Well, a jigger’s a mighty handy thing for haulin’
heavy loads,” explained Captain Ed.</p>

<p>“But it hain’t no pneumatic cushions for sore
bones,” chuckled the neighbour.</p>

<p>“No sir-ee! nor no ”C“ spring buggy, neither,”
laughed Captain Ed.</p>

<p>Before the boys reached the farm their breakfast
was well jounced down so that the home-made cake
and milk offered them by the Captain’s wife was most
welcome.</p>

<p>“We came to ride your colt,” declared Paul, between
bites.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! We came to visit you, Mrs. Blake, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Captain told us we <em>might</em> ride the colt,” hurriedly corrected
Dudley, with great diplomacy.</p>

<p>Paul stared and Mrs. Blake laughed understandingly
but she immediately invited the boys to come
with her to the pasture. She carried a bridle over her
arm and when they reached the lot Brownie was
coaxed to come over and nibble a lump of sugar from
her mistress’ hand. While doing this, the colt kept
her eyes on the two strange boys. But it is safe to
say that Brownie would not have submitted to the
bridle had it not been for the extra sugar the boys
gave her.</p>

<p>While Mrs. Blake held the colt by the forelock and
bridle, Paul, who had won the prized slip of paper,
tried to mount. The boy had taken short rides at
home on Billy Remington’s pony, but this was an
entirely new proposition. After a number of trials
and failures to mount, Dudley laughed and cried to
him:</p>

<p>“Hey, there! Come over and mount from this
stone wall!”</p>

<p>So Mrs. Blake led Brownie over to the wall while
Paul scrambled on top and in that way managed to
slide over on the colt’s silky bare back.</p>

<p>The moment Brownie felt a strange burden on her
back she grew unmanageable and tried in every way
to dislodge it.</p>

<p>“Grip her sides with your knees, boy!” called Mrs.
Blake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
The moment Brownie felt the restraining hand removed
from her bridle she started off on a lope for
the pasture gate. The boys had left it open as they
entered and through it the colt shot and made down
the lane, Paul dinging to her with might and main,
knowing it was now a case of “stick or flick.”</p>

<p>Just as both of them began to feel better acquainted
and hopes for enjoyment rose in Paul’s breast, the
horn of a passing motor tooted on the main road at
the end of the lane. The awful blast startled Brownie
so that she wheeled and tore back to her home in the
pasture.</p>

<p>Oh what a race that was! Over hummocks and
swales of fern! then suddenly the colt stopped short
by bracing her fore-feet and humping her back. And
as suddenly, Paul became an aviator. Luckily, he
landed in comparatively soft sod so that the only injury
he sustained was a loss of wind.</p>

<p>“I never knew Brownie to act like that before,”
commented the Captain’s wife, as Dudley and she
stood watching.</p>

<p>“Oh, Paul isn’t experienced like me! I can manage
her all right, you will see!” bragged Dudley, fearing
lest Mrs. Blake might decide to give Brownie her
freedom.</p>

<p>However, the colt had to be caught before Dudley
could ride, and both boys as well as Mrs. Blake grew
hot and tired in their endeavours. Finally, Brownie
was beguiled by some young tender carrots, and Dudley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
climbed upon her back while Mrs. Blake fed the
colt the delicacy.</p>

<p>“Run and shut that pasture gate, Paul!” shouted
Dudley.</p>

<p>Paul did as he was bid and then sat upon the top
rail to watch the boastful rider.</p>

<p>At first it seemed as if Brownie, too, was tired and
willing to be guided in the way she should go, so
Dudley began to have confidence and bravado.</p>

<p>“Look, Paul, this is the way to make them wheel!”
called he, digging his heel into the colt’s flank.</p>

<p>Wheel Brownie did, all right! She was off in a
jiffy, circling around the pasture, jumping the familiar
hummocks in her way, and finally sailing over the low
stone wall, then racing lickety-split down the lane.</p>

<p>Dudley had no objections to thumping over the soft
sod of the lane as it really was preferable to the
boulders in the pasture. But the colt became vexed
with the boy’s close clinging and with a tossing of her
mane resorted to an equine trick&mdash;that of trying to
brush off an unwelcome rider.</p>

<p>Try as he would, Dudley could not prevent Brownie
from passing under the low-hanging branches near the
end of the lane. Believing “discretion to be the better
part of valour” the boy slipped off before he was
“sawed” off by the neck.</p>

<p>The moment the colt realised her pest was gone she
kicked up her heels and snorted with derision.</p>

<p>Paul hugged himself in wild delight when he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
Dudley carefully limping back to the pasture, but their
troubles were soon forgotten by hearing the Captain
call for aides in catching some chickens that were
needed on Sunset Island.</p>

<p>The milder delights of rural life&mdash;chickens, pigs,
cows, yea, even sheep, came in for fervid attention
after that.</p>

<p>Then, early in the afternoon, well laden with baskets
full of fresh vegetables as well as the broilers,
eggs, and butter, the three mariners sailed the seas
again to Sunset Isle.</p>

<p>About five o’clock there came signs of a gathering
storm and the sky grew black in the north. The wind
had changed and blew from the northeast in increasing
violence. The Captain became anxious but saying
nothing to Mrs. Remington, trained the spyglass
in the direction from which the two boys and the dory
should first be seen.</p>

<p>A few moments’ scrutiny showed a tiny speck
gleaming white against the darkening waters. Soon,
with the naked eye, he was able to discern the little
craft about two miles north of the island. Then he
went in search of Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“Well, the two boys are piling home double quick&mdash;they’ll
be here in a few minutes,” said he, with
relief.</p>

<p>The mother was secretly relieved also, as she had
felt concerned over the delay of the boys and the approaching
storm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
“Let’s run up and see ’em come around the north
end!” shouted Dudley, excitedly.</p>

<p>“Let’s all go,” said Paul, looking at Mrs. Remington
invitingly.</p>

<p>Without parley they started for the nearest point
which the boys would make before running into the
lee of the island.</p>

<p>By the time the eager Islanders reached the north
end the dory was almost there.</p>

<p>“She’s carrying too much sail! They ought to’ve
reefed her,” exclaimed the Captain, trying to make
himself heard above the roaring of the wind.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re here now,” sighed Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>While every one on shore strained eyes to watch the
dory manœuvre as she approached the narrow passage
between the ledges of rock leading to safety in
the lee, an extra squall rendered the over-rigged boat
unmanageable. Over she went!</p>

<p>Quick as a flash, the two sailors were out on the
centreboard keel! She righted, but was full of water.
Billy ran down the sail while Fred chucked ballast
overboard.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the watchers on shore gasped and
every face went white, but Captain Ed, finding the
boys would be comparatively safe because of the airtight
compartments making the dory unsinkable, ran
swiftly to the float-stage and got his launch.</p>

<p>But quick as he was, the two sailors were more than
half a mile away, blown by the fury of the wind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
He just managed to catch up with them before they
were wrecked on the Isleboro shore. During this
flight before the storm the boys had not been idle.
One bailed madly while the other tried to keep her
head on to the storm.</p>

<p>It was a long hard tow for the little launch in the
teeth of the gale with the half-filled dory dragging
drunkenly behind. When at last, the boats came in
the lee of the island, the nerves of those afloat as
well as those on shore suddenly relaxed and made
every one feel and act foolish from relief.</p>

<p>Fred and Bill were rushed up to the bungalow for a
change into dry clothes, while Dudley and Paul heaped
wood upon the roaring fireplace in the living-room.
Mose got busy with an unusually good hot supper and
soon after, every one was hailed to sit down for the
belated meal.</p>

<p>As Mose brought in a great platter of broiled
chicken with hot waffles he remarked hypocritically:</p>

<p>“Ah don’ know wedder ders any flag up fo’ dessert
t’ night, cuz Ah ain’t done gone an’ made none!”</p>

<p>“Oh Mose! What do you call waffles?” laughed
Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, de’s jus’ chicken fixin’s!” grinned the southerner.</p>

<p>“Well just give me a pile of those same ‘fixin’s’ and
a jug of maple syrup and you can wave the flag sky-high
as far as I’m concerned,” remarked Billy, the
connoisseur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
“How, how, how!” echoed from the circle around
the table.</p>

<p>That night when dinner had been cleared away, the
family grouped itself in front of the drift-wood fire
and prepared to hear the tale of the cruise. The
storm was howling and raging without but the great
tongues of purple and green flame that shot up the
chimney from the drift wood suffused a cheery feeling
to the Islanders.</p>

<p>“We had a cinch getting up to Castine, with a
flood-tide and that nice southerly,” began Fred; “it
didn’t flush out until we got inside the harbour.”</p>

<p>“You know that little Nautilus Island, mother?”
asked Billy. “Well, we ran in back of that and over
to a fine little cove. We took out the fishing lines and
in fifteen minutes we had a mess of tom-cod.”</p>

<p>“Say, maybe tom-cod and bacon isn’t the food for
the gods! eh what, Bill!” remarked Fred, smacking
his lips at the memory of his savoury feast.</p>

<p>“You bet! We landed after catching enough fish
and made a good fire to broil them. Then we ate
lunch. We wound up on that cake Mose sneaked into
our hamper last night.”</p>

<p>Paul and Dudley exchanged looks that said as
plainly as words, “<em>Now</em> we know why Billy preferred
prunes!”</p>

<p>“You know, mother, we always wanted to explore
the Bagaduce River; well, this was a swell chance
with the tide still running up, so we up-anchored and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
started off. We’d have been home long before the
storm came if we hadn’t gone so far up the river.
But it was worth the trouble, wasn’t it, Bill?”</p>

<p>“Yeh! There’s the place where old Baron Castine
and the Tarratine Indians camped when Maine was
first settled,” added Billy.</p>

<p>“Then when the wind changed this afternoon, we
were up that river eating the last crumbs of cake.
It began to look a little squally so we considered we’d
better make tracks for home. And we sure did make
a track&mdash;all froth and foam. It didn’t get to be a
real storm you know, until about five o’clock, so that’s
why we hadn’t reefed the sail,” explained Fred.</p>

<p>“We went along fine for a time. I never knew the
dory to go so fast but finally we realised that we
needed that reef,” Billy continued. “We would have
run down the sail and put in the reef out in the open
bay but Fred said, ‘Oh, half a minute more will see
us in the lee of the island.’ We would have been
all right if that nasty little squall hadn’t caught us
just half a minute too soon!”</p>

<p>“Boys, you knew you ought to have a reef in the
sail, and hereafter, don’t wait that half-minute too
late to put it in. The cause of accidents and loss of
life is that same excuse&mdash;‘oh, we’ll be all right in half
a minute!’” warned Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“How does it feel to climb out on the centreboard
in a gale?” asked Dudley, curiously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
“Didn’t stop to diagnose the feeling!” laughed Fred.</p>

<p>“I just guess not!” added Billy.</p>

<p>“I bet you were glad there were air-tanks in your
dory, all right!” declared Paul.</p>

<p>“I just bet we were too!” sighed both adventurers.</p>

<p>And Fred added: “We knew we’d be all right if we
just got out the ballast, even though she was full of
water.”</p>

<p>“But all the same, we were glad to see the Captain
heave in sight through the spray, and then when we
got near the island it kinda felt good to see you all
waiting to welcome us,” smiled Billy.</p>

<p>“I never saw anything drift so fast in all my life&mdash;even
though the wind and tide were working together,”
said Dudley.</p>

<p>Advice is most uninteresting to youth and when
Mrs. Remington began to advise the reckless sailors,
Fred quickly changed the subject.</p>

<p>“Well, Dud&mdash;what did you and Paul do at the farm
to-day?”</p>

<p>Both boys plunged into the story of the broncho
busting each one giving high-coloured account of the
other’s inexperience in riding a colt. Then as they
arrived at the relation of the quieter sports of feeding
the livestock and catching chickens, they looked at
each other and finally doubled up in laughter.</p>

<p>“What’s the joke&mdash;tell us, too!” wondered Billy.</p>

<p>“How did you like the broilers to-night?” asked
Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
“Why, they tasted good as usual&mdash;why?” wondered
Fred.</p>

<p>“Because, we’ve heard that the flavour of a chicken
has to do with the way it is killed. How do you like
your chickens killed&mdash;heads chopped off or necks
wrung?” asked Paul.</p>

<p>“All the same to me as long as I get it,” replied
Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, how do you s’pose they’d taste if they were
suffocated to death?” persisted Dudley, and both Paul
and he laughed again.</p>

<p>“You didn’t do that, did you?” cried Edith, horrified.</p>

<p>“Well, two of the tender chickens we had to-night
were suffocated by Dud and me, but not intentionally,”
admitted Paul.</p>

<p>“You see, it was this way: We had been catching
chickens for the Captain and these two got away and
hid under the haystack outside the barn.</p>

<p>“The Captain started chopping off heads and I got
one chicken as it flounced around without its head,
and chased Paul with it. Just when Paul doubled in
his tracks, I was swinging the chicken about holding
it by one leg. He ran plump into it and then said I
<a name="lammed" id="lammed"></a><ins title="Original has lamned">lammed</ins> him with it! Ha, ha, ha!” chuckled Dudley.</p>

<p>“Well, you did, too, Dud! You were just going
to swing it at my head anyway when I turned to dodge
you! But I got even!” interrupted Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
“Paul ran me in the barn and chased me up into
the hayloft but I jumped out on this big haystack to
get away from him. He followed right after me and
both of us slid down the side and landed on top of
each other. One wild <a name="squawk" id="squawk"></a><ins title="Original has squak">squawk</ins> from the chickens underneath
us told how we had landed on top of them.
They died so quick they hadn’t time to make a will to
dispose of their heads,” laughed Dudley, at the
remembrance.</p>

<p>“We carried the two chickens back and told the
Captain of their unexpected end, and he said, ‘That’s
a new form of capital punishment.’”</p>

<p>While the children talked over the rural sports of
the Captain’s farm Mrs. Remington seemed absent-minded.
When they had worn the subject threadbare
however, she made a remark.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about the masked ball&mdash;you
should have been planning long before this as to the
costumes you intend wearing.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that we haven’t been planning?”
asked Fred, smilingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m glad if you have, but I haven’t heard
about it,” said she.</p>

<p>“Haven’t you heard a weird tincan sound coming
from the direction of the pump-house lately?” queried
Fred.</p>

<p>“Why, yes&mdash;I believe I have! What is it?” quizzed
his mother.</p>

<p>“That’s the secret of my costume. Nobody will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
ever guess what it is to be so I won’t tell beforehand,”
returned Fred.</p>

<p>“I’m going as Red Riding Hood!” exclaimed Edith.</p>

<p>“Dud was going to be a pirate but Billy told him of
some other good idea so I’m going to use the pirate’s
things,” said Paul.</p>

<p>“Yes, Bill and I are going to be a pair but we need
you to help us make the things, Mrs. Remington,”
added Dudley.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Why, mother, Dud and I want to be bears&mdash;a
white polar bear for me and a cinnamon bear for Dud,
and we need some old blankets for the suits,” explained
Billy.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to spoil any good blankets by cutting
them up for suits but Anna has some white cotton
flannel for the polar bear and I think I know where
there is some brown material that will do for the
other and you can sew the bear rug on the back of it,”
suggested Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“And maybe you and Anna can cut out and stitch
up the suits&mdash;that will be all, you know. Dud and I
will do all the rest,” wheedled Billy.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anything else to do after that, is
there?” laughed Anna.</p>

<p>“To make two bear skins seems a large order,
Billy,” said Mrs. Remington. Then thoughtfully,
added, “Maybe we can use the pattern of the sleeping
suits that have feet and mittens attached! And we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
have the sewing machine that will run up the seams
quickly.”</p>

<p>“Of course! It will be dead easy!” said Dudley.</p>

<p>“And be sure you leave enough room when you
cut out the stuff, to give us a chance to stuff pillows in
front. We’re going to be big fat bears, you see,”
added Billy, with concern.</p>

<p>Every one laughed, but Fred had an idea which he
mentioned. “Bill, you ought to rig up some strings
that connect with the inside so that you can wiggle the
ears and stumpy tail.”</p>

<p>“That’s what I will! Won’t it be fun?” laughed
Billy.</p>

<p>After that conversation, the time was given to the
making of costumes for the masque, Fred still
jealously guarding his secret work going on in the
pump-house while every one expressed the wildest
conjectures as to what he could be making!</p>

<p>The first time the two bears tried on their costumes,
Mose was heard singing his favourite revival
hymn, “Swing low, sweet chariot, goin’ fo’ t’carry me
home,” while he worked in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>Mischief uppermost in his thought, Billy whispered
to Dudley: “Say, let’s hide in Mose’s tent to-night
and when he goes to bed we’ll growl like bears and
jump out on him!”</p>

<p>“Great! But don’t let any one know or they’ll
stop us,” replied Dudley.</p>

<p>The tooting of the Orion’s whistle just then, interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
any further planning and every one rushed out
to meet the visitors. Mr. and Mrs. Charlton had a
plan to propose to Mrs. Remington, so the eldest went
into a secret conference from which the children were
excluded, but now and then a word sounded from
unwary speakers. Words like “Boston,” “Manage if
they will all co-operate” and “See Uncle Bill about
it,” made the boys curious.</p>

<p>When the conclave ended, the children besieged
Miss Travis to tell them what every one was going to
wear to the ball.</p>

<p>“Indeed we won’t tell!” said she, emphatically.</p>

<p>“Not much!” added Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>“Humph! Do you mean you’re going to wear bathing
suits, or cannibal costumes?” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“Oh, a little more material than those take, I hope!”
laughed Aunt Edith, while appreciating her nephew’s
quick wit.</p>

<p>“Wish we had thought of bathing suits&mdash;we could
have saved much expense and time,” said Uncle Tom,
regretfully.</p>

<p>“I think you ought to tell us what you are going
in!” persisted Billy.</p>

<p>“Ask me no questions and I’ll tell you no lies!”
retorted Uncle Tom, and there the matter rested.</p>

<p>That night the wild uproar in Mose’s tent testified
to the time the two bears attacked him. The rest of
the family rushed affrightedly over to rescue the
valuable cook, but found him upon the floor of his tent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
writhing in convulsions of fear with two savage bears
thumping on top of him.</p>

<p>A veil must be drawn over that harrowing scene,
but Mrs. Remington wondered whether her chef was
quaking in a fit of terror or only shaking in laughter&mdash;especially
as he had seen Anna sewing on the two
costumes for the bears.</p>

<h2><a name="ix" id="ix"></a>CHAPTER NINE<br />
<small>THE NIGHT OF THE MASKED BALL</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE night so anxiously anticipated came at last.
As there was no moon everything lay in velvety
blackness. This was considered opportune as it helped
to hide the maskers when the launches landed them on
the wharf of Isola Bella.</p>

<p>Fudge Attic presented a bright contrast to the darkness
out of doors, for it was gay with lights and
coloured bunting and the paraffine waxed floor all
ready waiting for impatient feet. Bridget, stationed
just off the landing of the stairway, queened it over
a huge punch-bowl filled with lemonade, while the
laundry had been transformed into a buffet given in
charge of Mose.</p>

<p>The music was furnished by the two captains, one
with his fiddle and the other with a concertina. As it
was impossible for both to play and keep time together,
they alternated in the demonstration of their
art.</p>

<p>Lanciers and quadrilles were the popular dances
with the captains, so they tuned up for a grand
march to begin with. The maskers, in couples,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
waited to take part although “every couple was not a
pair.”</p>

<p>A Grand Pasha with a diamond sunburst in the
front of his turban led a Red Cross nurse around the
attic; following came a Knight in (tin) armour with
a Gypsy Maiden. Then came a Happy Hooligan and
a Girlie Girl; next, Little Red Riding Hood and a
Pumpkin Clown and directly at their heels ran the two
bears on all fours, sniffing eagerly at the basket carried
by their prospective victim.</p>

<p>The Trail of the Lonesome Pine came stately and
slowly all by herself&mdash;the branches taking up such a
spread of room. After her danced the Yellow Kid
with the Spanish Maid who shook a tambourine tinkling
with bells. A bewitching Japanese consorted
with a well-filled Laundry Bag and the News-of-the-Day
came with a Breton peasant carrying a swaddled
babe. Last but not least the Pirate of Penzance
marched with a Pierrette.</p>

<p>With an excruciating wail from the fiddle, the
march ended and a breathless instant ensued when
every one tried to pierce the disguise of the others.
No one would speak for fear of being identified by
“next friends.” The two bears could growl of course,
and this they did to their own great satisfaction.</p>

<p>Captain Ed shouted in his most nautical voice,
“Take yer pardners for the lanciers!”</p>

<p>In feigned tones cavaliers invited Nurse, Bag and
Jap to step the light fantastic with them, while Bears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
clung to a Pine and Red Riding Hood until the sets
were all made up.</p>

<p>At the command “Salute pardners!” heads bowed
low and the two bears swayed bearfully from side to
side. Then at the call “Swing corners!” both bears
tried to hug the little Jap girl so closely that she
cried out to the Pasha for help.</p>

<p>During this lively dance the Lonesome-Pine Flo-Flo
left much of her Trail upon the floor and Mose
found it necessary to hurriedly sweep up the branches
with a broom.</p>

<p>Before the lanciers ended most of the maskers were
identified and therefore were known by their Christian
names. The Pasha, however, insisted upon the
deference due his rank and resented the familiar appellation
of “Uncle Bill.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the admiring circle drawn up about
the Grand Pasha, Miriam’s voice piped forth: “Why,
papa! You’ve got on mamma’s sunburst of diamonds!”</p>

<p>“S-sh&mdash;you impertinent Jap! Don’t you know that
Girlie Girl hasn’t discovered my decoration? Let me
bask in its rays while I may,” came from the Pasha
in wary accents.</p>

<p>At that moment the Tin Knight rattled up while the
Polar Bear growled out, “Listen to the Ford Car approaching.”</p>

<p>As Red Riding Hood turned to watch the Knight
in Armour trying to keep his tin-can plates in order, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
revelation came to her and she cried, “Oh, <em>now</em>
<a name="pronoun" id="pronoun"></a><ins title="Original has I I">I</ins> know what all that hammering in the pump-house
was for! But where did you find all the old empty
cans, Fred?”</p>

<p>The concertina now squawked out to its full length
and caused every one to choose a mate for the dance.
Captain Benton bawled, “All ready for a polker,” and
started the musical atrocity wheezing. At the same
time his body swayed and pitched like a ship in a
storm, keeping time with every long-drawn out extension
of the bellows. As his vivid imagination
pictured the old-time dances he used to step so merrily
with his best girl, the faster sounded the wails
from the concertina and more
<a name="erratic" id="erratic"></a><ins title="Original has eratic">erratic</ins> grew the time,
until finally, the dance ended in a wild riot.</p>

<p>Uncle Bill decided this was the time to calm excitement
by refreshing the inner man, particularly as
the little tots had to go to bed. So every one trooped
down to the well-filled laundry table where Mose was
kept busy handing our refreshments. Then once
more back in the attic, the fun waxed fast and furious
until Uncle Tom called for attention!</p>

<p>“I am now about to distribute slips of paper for
each one to write down the name of the costume considered
the winner. Whoever receives the most votes
will be presented with a prize. The one considered
having the funniest or oddest costume will also receive
a prize.”</p>

<p>This announcement was received with loud acclamations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of satisfaction and surprise, for it was not
known before. During the comparative quiet while
all were pondering the merits of the costumes, a loud
“Boom! Bang” came like a blast from the back bay.</p>

<p>Every one rushed to the eastern windows of the
attic and Captain Ed, being there first, yelled, “Fire!
Fire!”</p>

<p>The others gazed wildly from the windows as a
long sheet of flame forked up into the darkness of
the night.</p>

<p>“Boom! Boom! Bang!” came again and a mighty
Fourth of July display glittered back of the dark firs
fringing the shore. By this time, the Pasha, grabbing
a large fire-extinguisher, tore down the stairs and
went headlong down to the beach. The rest of the
maskers were not slow to follow so that before the
third explosion sounded they all were near enough
to see by the reflection of the flare that a blazing
launch was stranded on Isola Bella and already, like
a torch, one of the fir trees was burning fiercely.</p>

<p>The danger was evident to all for even the youngest
Islander knew that if once the firs caught fire, the
entire island was doomed; not only the trees and
buildings but also the peat-like soil would burn off of
the rocks.</p>

<p>The frantic Pasha, minus turban and sunburst and
with only one Turkish shawl trailing from his shoulders,
plied the chemicals incessantly while the Tin
Knight and the dusky Major-Domo of the buffet tore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
down blazing fragments of neighbouring trees and the
erst-while musicians bravely exerted their muscular
strength in pushing off the burning launch from the
wharf. And they finally succeeded but at the cost
of hair and hands. Uncle Tom, Yellow Kid and the
Two Bears quickly formed a bucket brigade of all
the other maskers, and with their aid the last spark
burning on the island was deluged and extinguished.</p>

<p>After the terrific battle and excitement with the
fire had calmed down a forlorn group were discovered
huddled on the rocks near the wharf. The owner
of the doomed launch gazed hopelessly at the burning
boat while his wife cried pitifully by his side.</p>

<p>Their story was soon told. The man was returning
from Belfast with three barrels of gasoline on board.
The gasoline caught fire&mdash;how, he could not tell.</p>

<p>Uncle Bill concluded that a back-fire from the
engine ignited the fumes from a leaky tank and of
course it took but a moment to wrap the entire launch
in flame.</p>

<p>The man and his wife had taken to their small boat
as soon as the fire burst forth, knowing of the awful
danger incurred from the presence of the three barrels
of gasoline. Even though they had escaped before the
explosions, both of them were burned, the man’s hands
being severely blistered.</p>

<p>It was long after midnight before the burns and
blisters had been given first-aid treatment; then a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
smudged and frazzled Masquerade Party were free to
go to bed.</p>

<p>The water-soaked Yellow Kid escorted a smoke-streaked
Pierrette and a skeleton Pine&mdash;nothing now
but a few threads and sticks left of the green plumes&mdash;to
the Orion and home. Thankful indeed, were
they that the fire had left them the Orion in which
to go home.</p>

<p>As for the Sunset Islanders: they were so excited
that no thought of sleep was entertained. It was
nearly dawn before the last whisper was silenced in
their tents. And then, Bill was heard to say, “Let’s go
over to Isola Bella the first thing in the morning and
have a look at the wreck!”</p>

<p>And his mother called, “If you boys don’t go to
sleep there won’t be any morning, because you’ll
sleep into the late afternoon.”</p>

<p>However, boys never fail to wake up early if there
is a circus or some other great excitement to be enjoyed,
so all of the Island boys were up and ready to
start for Uncle Bill’s the moment breakfast was
over.</p>

<p>Their intent was to view the wreck and take pictures
of the charred remains, but once having landed
on the wharf they found Uncle Bill with downcast
expression&mdash;a most unusual thing.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said he, taking them into his confidence,
“you remember the Pasha’s diamond sunburst of last
night?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Yes, they all did.</p>

<p>“Well, somehow, the Pasha in his undignified exit
from the ball-room lost his turban. Of course the
sunburst was with it. The turban has been found but
no sunburst!”</p>

<p>“Gee! What did Aunt Miriam say?” cried Billy,
sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Well&mdash;she is annoyed!”</p>

<p>“We’ll help you look for it, Uncle Bill,” instantly
volunteered the boys from Sunset Island.</p>

<p>“Start right in now&mdash;the sooner the quicker for
me!” replied Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>But the most careful and minute search by the
boys failed to locate anything like a brooch. Finally,
every one on Isola Bella was enlisted in the campaign,
but without success. Several old croquet balls,
some tennis balls, a lost doll of Betty’s and other valueless
miscellany were combed out from the tall ferns
but no diamonds.</p>

<p>Then Bill yelled with joy. “I’ve got it! Here is
the bunch of sparkles!”</p>

<p>Every one ran swiftly to be in “at the death,” but
it turned out to be a bit of broken cut-glass that lay
hidden in the dew-covered green moss.</p>

<p>The indefatigable work of the hunters had to be
rewarded whether the pin was found or not, so all
were invited to sit down to a well-laden table for
lunch.</p>

<p>They sat discussing all possible and impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
places where the diamonds might be, but Aunt Miriam
refused to be comforted and Uncle Bill seemed quite
unnatural in his rôle of penitent.</p>

<p>“Well, Miriam, you may have lost the diamonds
but still you are more fortunate than that poor man
and his wife who lost their launch last night,” remarked
Uncle Bill, surprised at his wife’s unusual
persistence in harping on her loss.</p>

<p>“But <em>I</em> didn’t lose it&mdash;you are the guilty one!” said
she.</p>

<p>“If I had that blamed old sunburst in my hand
to make you happy again, I’d help stake that poor
old duffer to a new launch! I swear I would!” declared
Uncle Bill, recklessly.</p>

<p>Quietly then, Aunt Miriam rose from her chair and
came around the table to lean over his shoulder. He
thought she was about to pat him consolingly on the
head and say, “Never mind, dear.”</p>

<p>So he raised his hand to clasp hers in token of her
ready sympathy when his fingers closed over something
that gave him a sharp jab.</p>

<p>“Ouch&mdash;by heck! That pesky pin!”</p>

<p>He held it out and looked hard at the cause of his
recent generous offer while every one laughed freely
at his predicament.</p>

<p>“Oh, thou false and treacherous woman! Had I
back once more the salty tears I shed o’er yon ferns
while seeking for this glittering bauble! Moved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
your pretended distress we have wasted the golden
moments of this glorious day for naught!”</p>

<p>The Islanders laughed again while Aunt Miriam
smiled.</p>

<p>“But it was not wasted time nor loss of tears&mdash;for
both impelled you to act the Good Samaritan,” said
his wife.</p>

<p>“Boys, how much do you suppose I’ll <em>have</em> to donate
now, to ease off my conscience regarding that launch?”
asked Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>Opinions varied. Billy, taking the part of his namesake
thought the man deserved little because of his
evident carelessness in carrying gasoline in barrels
on his launch.</p>

<p>Fred suggested that every one chip in to help, but
Fred had a larger allowance than the younger boys,
so Paul, Billy and Dudley made no reply to this plan.</p>

<p>Then, as usual, the feminine contingent carried the
vote in the interests of charity and Uncle Bill was
mulcted a goodly sum.</p>

<p>“But what I want to know is, ‘Where did Aunt
Miriam find that sunburst?’” queried Fred.</p>

<p>And amid appreciative smiles, that fair lady told
how, amid the excited rush from Fudge Attic the
night before, she had found the diamond brooch
sparkling on the floor. She had quietly retrieved it
but had no thought of playing any joke on the Pasha
until she saw his very preoccupied manner and his
avoidance of conversation with her. She was not supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
to have missed the jewel and he was postponing
the evil time as long as possible.</p>

<p>After lunch, several games of tennis were enjoyed
and when it came time to return to Sunset Island
Elizabeth said, “I may as well sail back with you, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, ’cause we’re all going to Belfast in the morning
to replenish the commissary department,” answered
Fred.</p>

<p>“Who’s going?” demanded Paul, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Everybody who wants to&mdash;we are taking the
Medric and expect to spend the day.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll see us up there too, then, as we
are going to Belfast to shop before Uncle Bill goes
away&mdash;he expects to leave here next week, you know,”
said Aunt Miriam.</p>

<p>“Oh, won’t we have fun in Belfast&mdash;all together!”
cried Miriam.</p>

<p>Billy seemed to be thinking of a plan formed the
moment he heard Uncle Bill would be in Belfast the
next day. So now he turned to ask a question.</p>

<p>“Say, Uncle Bill, you know, one time father said I
could have the old engine that was taken from the
launch he sold two years ago. Do you think you
could help me sell that engine in Belfast and get
enough for it to help mother think she can afford to
add the rest of the price for a launch?”</p>

<p>Uncle Bill’s eyes twinkled. “Well, not a brand new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
launch exactly, but it will help buy that old one you’ve
had your eye on for the past month!”</p>

<p>“How much does the owner want for it, Billy?”
asked Fred.</p>

<p>“Sixty dollars&mdash;and every one says it’s the biggest
bargain at that price!” exclaimed Billy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“That’s a good business idea of yours, Billy&mdash;about
the old engine. Suppose you take it with you to-morrow
and we will see how much we can raise on it,”
responded Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>“Thanks, awfully, Uncle Bill!”</p>

<p>When it came to trading the old launch engine the
next day Uncle Bill and his namesake proved themselves
to be almost as good Yankees at bargaining as
the man who bought it. And the fifteen dollars paid
Billy looked mighty good to him as it meant that he
was so much nearer the goal of his heart’s desire.</p>

<p>The chief reason for the Islanders being so eager to
go to Belfast was soon revealed after the arrival of the
boats. An earnest pilgrimage started at the ironmonger’s
the moment the trade of the engine was consummated,
and continuing up the hilly street ended at
the ice-cream soda-fountain of the drug store.</p>

<p>The proprietor made his own syrups and cream and
the cooling beverages he dispensed were like nectar.
The adults of the party appreciated this fully as much
as the juveniles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Much to Teddy’s joy, they all happened to be in Belfast
the day which was the one advertised by the
druggist offering a balloon to every one who made
a ten-cent purchase. Thus it came to pass that the
downward trail of the Sunset Islanders was marked
by shreds of exploded rubber “Zeppelins.”</p>

<p>Loaded down to the gunwales so that the “lee-scuppers
ran with blood” of beets, tomatoes, corn, onions
and other fruit (?) the Medric turned her prow to the
south and Sunset Isle.</p>

<p>A peaceful calm brooded over the members of the
party&mdash;the lunch at the Belfast tea-room had been
supplemented by many extras in the grocery store so
that no one missed Mose’s generous midday fare.</p>

<p>“Say, Billy, got any more of them cocoanut
jumbles?” asked Dudley, wistfully, after a silence.</p>

<p>“No&mdash;I only got a dozen. Ask Edith for some
of her ginger-snaps.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a bag of peanuts&mdash;Virginia Jumbos. Want
some?” asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Children, <em>do</em> remember your poor weary stomachs!
They will be crying for rest if you don’t!” sighed Mrs.
Remington.</p>

<p>And the ever thoughtful children, wishing to allay
their mother’s sighs and fears, rather than limit their
gustatory joys moved forward where the Captain
stood with Fred steering the boat.</p>

<p>“It’s a lucky thing for us that this Belfast trip only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
happens once in a while,” remarked Anna, meaningly.</p>

<p>While cracking and chewing the two quarts of hot
peanuts offered by Elizabeth, the Islanders bethought
them of one of the Captain’s stories.</p>

<p>“Say, Captain, how about those pirates that sailed
the seas&mdash;any up around here in olden times?” hinted
Billy.</p>

<p>“We-ll, I’ve hearn tell of some. They do say that
Cap’n Kidd plied his trade in these waters, too. But
the worst feller ever known was Manum. Why, he
was so wicked there’s a song about <em>him</em>! And my
father said it didn’t half do the pirate justice, either!”</p>

<p>“Oh, do let us hear it, Captain!” urged the children.</p>

<p>With deprecatory coughs and some clearings of the
throat the Captain began singing in a nasal tenor the
ballad of Bold Manum, a curious rhyme with a salty
flavour:</p>

Captain Ed sang the pirate’s song with such vivid
interpretation and dramatic gesticulations that his
audience felt a delightful shiver run along their spines.
When he finished, a wild applause rewarded his effort.</p>

<p>Then Elizabeth was stirred to emulate the Captain’s
donation to music so she offered to sing another old-time
sailors’ song called “Strike, Strike the Bell.”</p>

<p>This was a favourite with Fred and Billy so they
joined in and soon every one took up the refrain:</p>

<p>The song ended, the peanut bag was emptied, and
the crackers all gone, when the Medric came to glide
up close to the float-stage. The passengers jumped
off and rushed up to the bungalow calling for Mose.</p>

<p>“Supper most ready, Mose? We’re all as hungry
as wolves!” cried each and every one of the young
Islanders; but Anna exchanged looks with Mrs. Remington,
who shook her head over the ever-recurrent
question: “Are the stomachs of young people lined
with a metal that never wears out?”</p>

<h2><a name="x" id="x"></a>CHAPTER TEN<br />
<small>FOR THE HONOUR OF THE BLACK BEARS</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">“</span>W</span>HO wants to sail over to Rosemary and bring
back some burlap bags of hay?” called
Fred, one rather cloudy morning when every one
felt undecided about doing anything on account of
the weather.</p>

<p>The three younger boys hastily volunteered and
were told to get ready.</p>

<p>“Say, this is a case of sou’westers and oilskins,
boys,” called Fred, when he saw them coming from
the bungalow with caps and sweaters.</p>

<p>“Why do you need hay&mdash;we haven’t a horse or
cow to feed?” questioned Dudley.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” replied Billy; “who knows what
sort of a wild animal may be prowling around the
island pretty soon.” As he spoke with a certain air
of knowledge he buttoned a sou’wester strap high
under his chin.</p>

<p>“Say&mdash;I bet I know!” laughed Paul, eyeing Billy,
then Fred carefully.</p>

<p>“What?” demanded Dudley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
“We’re going to stuff a bear for the Mishi-mokwa
game, aren’t we, Fred?”</p>

<p>“Right you are! We will, if Elizabeth will help us
with the sewing of the burlap,” replied Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, is that why you picked over that iron junk in
Belfast and bought all those sharp-ended rods for
spear points?” added Paul.</p>

<p>“When can we make it and have our first game?”
asked Billy.</p>

<p>“The sooner we get started the sooner we will have
the bear finished, and the rest depends upon that!”
replied Fred.</p>

<p>When Uncle Tom heard about the project he willingly
donated the burlap bags and hay. Trixie, very
curious as she stood in the drizzle in her checked skirt,
begged the boys to tell her all about the bear-spearing
game.</p>

<p>“You’re going to be invited to the next Council and
then you’ll see how to do it,” replied Billy.</p>

<p>“When will that be?” asked Trixie.</p>

<p>“Next Thursday afternoon at three o’clock,” said
Fred.</p>

<p>“And then the Honour of the Black Bears will be
upheld!” declared Billy.</p>

<p>“Now what do you mean by that,” again asked
Trixie.</p>

<p>“Just come to the Council and find out,” was all
Billy would say.</p>

<p>But Fred explained. “You see, Billy and I really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
belong to the Black Bear Tribe when we are home so
we are going to challenge all of the members of the
Pentagoet Tribe here and the visitors to a Bear
Spearing contest. You can join the others if you like
and try to beat our score.”</p>

<p>Trixie followed the boys to the shore and waved
farewell until they were out of sight in the misty
morning. Then she sat on the steps oblivious alike
of her damp skirt and the drops of moisture that
sparkled on her curls, longing for a camp-life and the
simple fun of the Woodcrafters. Finally she realised
she was becoming thoroughly wet from the fine rain
so she went dolefully back to the house.</p>

<p>At Sunset Island, all hands watched Fred construct
the bear. He found he would not need Elizabeth’s
help for the sewing as his practice with sailor’s
palm and needle came in good even if the stitches were
uneven.</p>

<p>What a ludicrous creature it was when completed!
A loop of rope for a tail, another for a nose, and a
third on the middle of the back. Billy and Paul
helped to swing the beast from between two tall
birches and Dudley took the first fling of a spear
at it. Dudley had occupied himself in trimming into
a wooden spear one of the small standing dead firs
that crowded the underbush of the island.</p>

<p>This gave Fred an idea.</p>

<p>“Say, boys, each one of you can make a lot of those
kind of spears and we might use them for practice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
“That’s right! The old bear will last longer than
if we used the iron spears on him,” added Billy.</p>

<p>As night came on the fog shut in again and Fred
called the boys from their spear-making to look after
their tents for the night. That evening the bungalow
fire made a cheery spot to gather about, for the dampness
out-of-doors was chilly and unfriendly.</p>

<p>“Do you think it will be foggy all day to-morrow?”
asked Dudley.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so, but we musn’t kick if it is, as we
have had fine weather right along,” replied Fred.</p>

<p>“I know of a fine game to play in foggy weather!”
hinted Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>Instantly, she had every one’s attention&mdash;as she
knew she would.</p>

<p>“The wood-boxes need a new supply and so many
valiant Woodcrafters about here ought to be valiant
woodchoppers for a change!” said she.</p>

<p>“Oh piffle! what a game!” sniffed Paul.</p>

<p>The others all laughed at his disgusted look but
Fred said, “We’ll do it, mother! Of course it’s a
great sacrifice of valuable time, but we would throw it
away recklessly for <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>“I am happy to have such generosity shown me,
seeing that I am the only one who ever sits before the
big fireplace!” laughed Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>As she seldom had time to sit down with the others
when they told stories and played games before the
great fire, the children appreciated the sarcasm. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
the following morning every available container was
filled full of chopped wood.</p>

<p>The morning was foggy so, the wood-boxes attended
to, the boys fished off the float-stage for
lobster bait. Sculpins and flounders were caught and
by this time the mist began lifting. The Captain
thought they might row out to the traps to bait them
and before the last lobster trap was baited and heaved
over the side of the boat, the sun shone out. A little
breeze from the west soon scattered the remaining
curls of fog and the day turned out to be dazzlingly
bright.</p>

<p>For all their patient working the boys found nothing
but crabs and star-fish in the traps that morning,
and they began to fear that the lobster supply around
Sunset Island had been exhausted.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we’ve got to do, we’ve got to
change the traps and put them over towards the Isleboro
side,” said Dudley. “I saw a lot of trap-buoys
over that way.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know those fishermen would gladly set
their traps here if it wasn’t for us being on the
island?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>And the Captain added: “Bill’s right; and some of
these men say they’re goin’ to come and set their traps
here anyway.”</p>

<p>“You’d think that all the refuse from fish that we’ve
been throwing out from our fish-drying work would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
have attracted the lobsters long ago, wouldn’t you?”
ventured Billy.</p>

<p>“They’re queer critters, all right,” admitted Captain
Ed.</p>

<p>“I guess it will be clear for the bear-spearing to-morrow,
after all,” Paul said, looking at the blue sky.</p>

<p>“I’ll finish my last iron spear-head to-night and be
all ready for it,” added Fred.</p>

<p>Supper over that evening, Fred worked on the
spear-head while the other boys tried various ways of
tying knots. As the Captain was a master-hand at
that craft, he was appealed to and when the boys had
been taught to tie some sailor-knots he showed them
several trick knots which caused great interest. Then,
Mrs. Remington showed them how to do the string
trick called “Throwing the Fish Spear.”</p>

<p>The following day was clear and sunny and the
usual attendance at Council was counted upon by the
Islanders. But they were in for a surprise.</p>

<p>When the guests began to arrive, a number of
strange launches were seen in the wake of the Orion.
It was then learned that neighbouring cottagers of
Aunt Edith’s had heard of the fun and entertainment
provided at a Woodcraft Council and had begged permission
to be invited to the next one held on Sunset
Island.</p>

<p>A hearty welcome was extended the visitors and the
Council opened. When the tally of the last Council
was read the guests laughed at the account of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
poetry contest. Then came the call for report of
scouts.</p>

<p>Billy saluted. “Oh Chief! I have to report that
being desirous of obtaining a photograph of a young
fish-hawk, or osprey, in a nest on Spruce Island, I
climbed the tree carrying Paul’s kodak on my back.
I found the young osprey dead, hanging dismembered
upon a branch below the nest. I could not determine
whether this was due to an accident or not. Evidently
the bird had been dead some time. I found the
tails of seven flounders in and about the nest, also the
remnants of other fish.”</p>

<p>“I also found a piece of bamboo netting woven into
the nest. I managed to climb above and snap a photograph
of the nest and dead bird but I regret to say
that it was a failure. The film was returned with
nothing but blurs on it, so I think I made a mistake in
focussing properly.”</p>

<p>A discussion ensued over the possible cause of the
death of the osprey and the suggestion of accident was
decided to be the plausible one.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom made a report on the presence of porcupines
in his apple-orchard and asked the help of
some brave hunter to help exterminate them. Billy
instantly volunteered and was accepted, providing he
came alone. Mr. Charlton knew that Billy was perfectly
trustworthy with firearms, but accidents can
easily happen when a number of boys are taken along.</p>

<p>“Oh Chief! I have an offer to lay before the parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
and guardians here present. I will train the boys
in target-shooting and offer a prize to that one who
excels at a given time,” now added Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>“How, How!” echoed around the Council Ring at
this news.</p>

<p>The vote was unanimous on the part of the younger
faction so Fred put it to a motion.</p>

<p>“Oh Chief! I move that a committee be formed
of parents to deliberate over this plan,” said Mrs.
Remington.</p>

<p>“Second the motion!” added Mrs. Farwell.</p>

<p>On the final vote the motion was carried that the
mothers form a committee to report later&mdash;not necessarily
to the Council but to Uncle Tom or Fred.</p>

<p>The time devoted to the granting of honours now
arrived and Elizabeth sprang to her feet.</p>

<p>“Oh Chief! I have a claim to present in behalf of
another.”</p>

<p>“Present the claim,” said Wita-tonkan with dignity.</p>

<p>“In behalf of Wita-tonkan of the Black Bear Tribe,
I, Pah-hlee-oh of the Apamwamis Tribe, claim low
honour for constructing a bear, for the Bear Spearing
Game according to the standards in the Book of
Woodcraft, edition of 1915,” stated Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Witnessed by Edward Blake, Dudley West, and
William Remington,” concluded she, proudly looking
at her brother Fred.</p>

<p>This was indeed a surprise to Fred as he really had
forgotten that his recent work on the bear constituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
and counted for a <em>coup</em>. Nevertheless, he announced
as usual,</p>

<p>“You have heard this claim: it is properly witnessed
and moreover will soon be demonstrated at this
Council&mdash;what is your pleasure?”</p>

<p>The decision was unanimous for granting the <em>coup</em>
and the visitors’ attention was drawn to the burlap
bear swinging between the trees just beyond the Council
Ring.</p>

<p>Then the Chief announced: “Friends and members
of the Pentagoet Tribe, you may not know that
Shingebis and I are old Woodcraft Indians of the
Honourable Tribe of Black Bear. To-day we wish
to appear as Black Bears in our allegiance and introduce
some of the customs of our Tribe. One of these
is the challenging for scalps.</p>

<p>“Each Black Bear wears a black scalp-lock when he
is in Council. Here is mine,” and Wita-tonkan held
aloft a long strand of black horsehair with a loop of
thong attached.</p>

<p>“This represents our life! When we challenge for
scalps we stake our life. If we lose we have to remain
dead until the Tribe votes us alive again.”</p>

<p>Advancing to the Council Fire Wita-tonkan, in the
name of Shingebis and himself challenged the Pentagoet
Tribe or any visitors present, to a Bear Spearing
Contest for scalps!</p>

<p>Paul jumped up and cried, “We accept!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
And a chorus of “Hows!” showed that every one
present was brave and daring.</p>

<p>“Oh Chief! How can we pay up if we have no
hirsute adornments similar to the Black Bear scalps?”
asked Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>“Every one who enters this contest must agree to
forfeit a scalp like this or similar. <em>They can be procured!</em>”
sternly answered Wita-tonkan.</p>

<p>A babel of voices then arose and finally it appeared
that Wita-tonkan and Shingebis had twenty opponents
arrayed against them in the contest.</p>

<p>“Gee! If the Black Bears win we won’t be able
to see them&mdash;they will be so covered with scalps,”
cried Dudley.</p>

<p>“Oh Chief! that reminds me! What happens
should the two Black Bears lose? How can two
scalps be divided among so many Pentagoets?” inquired
Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>“Why, we each get a lock of hair from their two
heads!” laughed Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>“I should say not! We each have one life to lose
and we give what we have, one life apiece,” retorted
the Chief.</p>

<p>“Then, <em>who</em> will get your two scalps?” persisted
Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>“No one&mdash;the Black Bears will get <em>yours</em>!” boasted
Fred.</p>

<p>Every one laughed at that but the Chief added
seriously: “Our two scalps, <em>should</em> we lose, will become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
the possession of the two Braves opposing, who
make the highest scores of individual hits out of the
five shots allowed each contestant.”</p>

<p>That was plain and just so they all filed over to the
burlap bear.</p>

<p>What a fight that was! The children and inexperienced
spearsmen were soon cleared off of the
field of action. Paul made a hit but it counted for
little as it was not near the red-painted heart of the
bear. Dudley scored in the same manner. Elizabeth
hit the bear twice but alas! only one spear stuck in so
she only scored once. Then they all shouted for a
Black Bear. Shingebis stepped forward to try his
skill.</p>

<p>The bear was swung erratically but impartially by
Captains Ed and Benton. Billy chose his time well
and took careful aim. Two of his spears dangled
from the bear’s body, one in the very rim of the heart’s
circle thus counting ten for his score and the other
counting five, making a total of fifteen for his side.</p>

<p>“How! How!” shouted a chorus of voices.</p>

<p>“For the Honour of the Black Bears!” said Billy
solemnly.</p>

<p>“Now, watch your Uncle Bill!” cried that worthy,
and kerplunk went a spear! It struck the ground
below the clumsy beast.</p>

<p>Every one yelled but Uncle Bill had four more
trials. In these he netted his side fifteen, which with
the three hits of Elizabeth, Paul and Dudley, totalled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
the Pentagoets eighteen against fifteen of the Black
Bears.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom now tried and amid great excitement
made a hit near the heart-circle, counting five.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” shouted Paul, dancing wildly about.</p>

<p>“Twenty-three for our side!” yelled Dudley,
throwing a rock out to sea in order to give vent to his
pent-up frenzy.</p>

<p>“Beat it, Wita-tonkan&mdash;for the Honour of the
Black Bears,” urged Billy, anxiously.</p>

<p>“Never fear!” spoke the Island Chief with confidence.
“Have I speared the Bear at Wyndy-goul
and at Lake Peequo for naught?”</p>

<p>And his boast proved good!</p>

<p>The three hits made by Wita-tonkan raised the
Black Bear score, first to sixteen, then to twenty-one
and finally to thirty-one.</p>

<p>“Scalp! scalp! Let’s dance the scalp-dance!”
screamed Billy shrilly, with overwrought nerves.</p>

<p>“How! How!” came from the others as they participated.</p>

<p>“Now pay up your scalps!” ordered Fred.</p>

<p>“But, this is a serious matter. Here! All you
Pentagoets and visitors&mdash;don’t you know we’re all
dead ones!” cried Uncle Bill in a sepulchral tone.</p>

<p>Thereupon, without further warning, he fell to the
ground, dragging Edith, Miriam and Paul down with
him in the death-struggle.</p>

<p>The other losers of scalps failed to realise their demise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
in such a dramatic manner, and contented themselves
with laughing heartily at Uncle Bill and his
three wriggling understudies.</p>

<p>“Where can we procure scalps?” asked Aunt Edith.</p>

<p>“Why, at any harness store. Get the horsehair
dingle-dangles that we use as a substitute for the
Black Bear brand,” replied Elizabeth, laughingly.</p>

<p>“I’m going to get a bright red one to show my
heart’s blood!” exclaimed Paul.</p>

<p>“Then you’d better get another to use after the
tribe votes you alive again,” advised Billy.</p>

<p>“All right, then I’ll get a blue one for that.”</p>

<p>As there were so many dead Indians about, the
Council of the living reconvened and voted the dead
hunters alive again. Bill was sent out to bring them
in, and then the Council closed by singing the Zuni
Sunset song.</p>

<p>Every one stood in a semi-circle facing the red
glow beyond the western mountains, the light fading
perceptibly as they sang.</p>

<p>From the launches that bore away the visitors, the
good-byes floated back to the group on shore. And
loud and long was the chorus that came from Trixie
and the Islanders on the float-stage, for the girl had
been invited to remain and visit Elizabeth for a few
days, and the young people were all delighted to have
her with them.</p>

<p>The weather was very unsettled for the next few
days, but that did not interfere with Trixie’s enjoyment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
She sailed with Fred, fished with the others,
and entered into all of the Island sports with an
energy that quite won the admiration of the boys.</p>

<p>“Say, Trix, are you going to wear that checked
skirt again to-day? I bet that’s what hoodoos the
weather!” said Bill, one morning, seeing that the sun
failed to shine.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am!”</p>

<p>“Then, we’ll postpone our walk on Isleboro, for
every time you wear that skirt it rains,” continued
Fred, teasingly.</p>

<p>“How ridiculous!”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind! If you just try another
skirt for our sakes, I bet the sun will shine!” asserted
Dudley, who saw the look exchanged between Fred
and Bill.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe in signs and hoodoos but to
please you boys I will wear my short corduroy skirt&mdash;and
it’s better anyway for walking through the
woods,” admitted Trixie.</p>

<p>The boys knew it would be a fine day, and the mist
that hid the sun would soon be dispelled, so they
chuckled to themselves that Trixie would believe it
was her change of skirt.</p>

<p>The walk on Islesboro was for the purpose of completing
the tree and flower <em>coups</em> of the Pentagoet
Tribe and incidentally the sail over to Crow Cove
would be enjoyable and add mileage to Fred’s sailing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
“How many miles have you made now, Fred?”
asked Paul.</p>

<p>“Just one hundred and one miles.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’ll do it all right,” said Dudley.</p>

<p>“I intend to,” added Fred, quietly.</p>

<p>“Let’s sail over to the old ‘wrack,’” laughed Billy,
in imitation of Maine sailors.</p>

<p>“Maybe there will be enough water under her stern
so’s we can sail close under and climb aboard if you
want to,” suggested Fred.</p>

<p>This met with approval for every one wanted a
good chance to see what a “dead-eye” was and this
was an old-timer; though everything removable had
long since been taken, the rows of “dead-eyes” stuck
up along her sides empty for years of the shrouds
they formerly secured.</p>

<p>“What queer names things on boats have,” commented
Trixie.</p>

<p>“You will admit that dead-eyes are appropriate in
their connection with shrouds,” laughed Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“I never thought of that,” chuckled Billy.</p>

<p>“And why is that rope you are holding called a
‘sheet’?” wondered Trixie.</p>

<p>“Because it is fastened to a corner of a sail,” replied
Fred. “Sheet came from the old word meaning
something that stuck out, or shot out. Shoot and
shot are related words, you know. And as corners
stick out a corner of the sail was first called a sheet-line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
and then the name was applied to the line itself
leading from the corner.”</p>

<p>“Well! Where did you find all that out?” said his
sister, surprised.</p>

<p>“In the encyclopedia; you see, I too thought the
name a queer one so I looked it up.”</p>

<p>“Maybe sheets for a bed were called that because
they had corners,” ventured Paul.</p>

<p>“Yes, the book thinks so,” returned Fred. “And
the big anchor that was depended upon for safety was
called a ‘sheet-anchor’&mdash;not because it had corners but
because it was shot out into the water. The whole
word means a mixup of things but all we need
remember is that the sheet here is the line and not
the sail.”</p>

<p>“I brought my camera to take a picture of the
wreck,” said Paul, as they saw the vessel.</p>

<p>“Wait until I get on her and then take me too, will
you, Paul?” asked Billy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course he will, Billy, and we will name it ‘The
Two Wrecks,’” laughed Dudley.</p>

<p>When the mariners were once more sailing the seas,
Paul remarked, “I wonder if Trix knows the sun is
shining!”</p>

<p>“Why, so it is!” cried the girl.</p>

<p>“See there! We told you that checked skirt was
the hoodoo,” teased Fred.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me you believe it would have rained
had I worn it?” scoffed Trixie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
“Why not? It brought rain every other day!”
laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“Pooh! Elizabeth told me that to-day promised
fair, so I know you were <a name="only" id="only"></a><ins title="Original has only only">only</ins> trying to tease
me.”</p>

<p>The walk through the woods was enjoyed by all
and the boys were delighted to find that they could
add enough trees to their lists to make the twenty-five
required for a <em>coup</em>. With beech, mountain-ash,
aspen-poplar, white-cedar, and three kinds of birches
and moose-leaf maple to add to the fir, spruce, and
pine found on Sunset Island they were able to finish
their collection begun with chestnut, catalpa, and various
oaks, found in more southerly latitudes.</p>

<p>That evening, as Fred read aloud the list of trees
for a Grand <em>Coup</em>, Elizabeth, the poetess, turned them
into rhyme. Trixie watched her scribble and when
through, took it and read it aloud to the circle in the
living-room.</p>

<p class="center">THE GRAND COUP FOR TREES</p>

<div class="line">I want to know the trees that grow, they’re interesting, you see;</div>

<div class="line">Don’t blame the dog-wood for this verse, though doggerel it be,</div>
<div class="line">Its flowers are much more beautiful than any lines from me.</div>
<div class="line">I’d like to tell you all about the trees both great and small;</div>
<div class="line">’Twould keep me very busy to even name them all!</div>
<div class="line">The pine tree&mdash;that fine tree! the elms and the oaks,</div>
<div class="line">Make wood enough and good enough for any sort of folks.</div>
<div class="line">The beech tree, the peach tree together on the strand;</div>
<div class="line">The pretty girls the “peaches” love the “beaches’” shining sand.</div>
<div class="line">The palm tree, the balm tree, the bamboo, the teak;</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
<div class="line">And others from the Orient if we go there to seek.</div>
<div class="line">The orange tree, whose blossoms be much loved on wedding days;</div>
<div class="line">The lemon and the grape-fruit, too, are kin in many ways.</div>
<div class="line">The apple and the apricot, the plum tree and the pear;</div>
<div class="line">The fruits of these are sure to please somebody, anywhere.</div>
<div class="line">The cedar and the hemlock, the fir and pine and spruce,</div>
<div class="line">Are members of one family with wood for any use.</div>
<div class="line">The cotton-wood, the willow for canoes and Indian beds;</div>
<div class="line">The aspen and the poplar that rustles o’er our heads,</div>
<div class="line">The hickory, the walnut, the pecan, now are all</div>
<div class="line">Nut bearers in the autumn to feed us in the fall.</div>
<div class="line">Mulberry trees, wild cherry trees; the mango and the date;</div>
<div class="line">The last you see must be the tree that keeps some men out late.</div>
<div class="line">The sycamores&mdash;yes by the scores they line the river’s brim.</div>
<div class="line">We know these trees afar, with ease, by mottled bark and limb.</div>
<div class="line">Persimmon and the chinquapin sound good and nice and sweet;</div>
<div class="line">We one and all late in the fall enjoy their fruits to eat.</div>
<div class="line">The china berry is a very charming, flowering tree.</div>
<div class="line">It grows down south, in spite of drought&mdash;up north it cannot be.</div>
<div class="line">The pendant locust blooms look good; the tree is fine for shade;</div>
<div class="line">For posts that last ’tis better wood than any other made.</div>
<div class="line">The butternut, the chip-munks’ friend, the wood is soft and dark;</div>
<div class="line">We know it by its frond-like leaves as well as by its bark.</div>
<div class="line">The maple is a staple tree, its syrup very sweet</div>
<div class="line">Its wood is good for floors you see; in its shade we like to meet.</div>
<div class="line">The hazel bush might raise a blush if called a tree, ’tis true;</div>
<div class="line">(The rhyme is fierce but in a rush we stop at nought&mdash;do you?)</div>
<div class="line">The chestnut is the best nut, its wood is very good;</div>
<div class="line">’Tis easy to split and easy cut; the nuts are good for food.</div>
<div class="line">The basswood’s wood is fine for trunks, when bound with duck or leather.</div>
<div class="line">Saw up tree trunks in boards, not chunks, and fasten them together.</div>
<div class="line">The elder and the alder much delight in swamps to grow.</div>
<div class="line">The cedar also likes the touch of water at its toe.</div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
<div class="line">The sweet gum and the cypress are in Dixie’s forests found.</div>

<div class="line">In May old dark green needles show a bushy background there&mdash;</div>
<div class="line">While new light shoots upstanding, grow like Christmas candles’ flare.</div>
<div class="line">Of beauty out-of-doors in Spring, of trees like these, and more,</div>

<h2><a name="xi" id="xi"></a>CHAPTER ELEVEN<br />
<small>WITA-TONKAN LEFT IN CHARGE</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">A</span>T breakfast, Sunday morning, Mrs. Remington
announced a startling piece of news.</p>

<p>“Friends, children, and Sagamore-in-the-making! I
have to surprise you! Aunt Edith and I are going to
Boston on a visit. While I am away you girls are to
stay with Aunt Flo-Flo at Rosemary. Anna and
Teddy are going to Isola Bella, and you boys are to
remain with Fred in charge of the Island. How do
you like the plan?”</p>

<p>A mixed chorus arose: “Oh, don’t go!” and “Fine!
fine!” “We’ll be good!” and “How long will you
stay?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington laughed but waited to hear from
Fred. He rose and keeping an eagle eye on his
future vassals, proclaimed: “Order shall be kept, or I,
Wita-tonkan, will perish in the attempt! Wough! a
Black Bear has spoken!”</p>

<p>“When you are in charge, you can really earn your
title of ‘Island Chief,’ Fred,” remarked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“When are we going to Mrs. Charlton’s?” asked
Trixie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
“I suppose you girls can wait and see me off. You
can pack your suit-cases for a week or ten days and
the Captain can set you ashore at the Rosemary landing
after leaving me at the steamer wharf. We are
going by the Boston boat you know&mdash;it is much
cooler.”</p>

<p>What a bustle there was during the two days that
ensued.</p>

<p>On Monday, Aunt Flo-Flo and Mrs. Charlton came
in the Orion to visit the Islanders.</p>

<p>“I thought it best to come over and take an inventory
of my ready-made family,” laughed Aunt
Flo-Flo.</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll be good as saints if you’ll only take us
on enough motor-trips to last a month!” exclaimed
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Maybe the boys would like to sail over for a day’s
trip, too,” suggested Aunt Edith, but the boys had
disappeared from the porch. Fred had given them
the high sign for a pow-wow to be held in his tee-pee
immediately!</p>

<p>That evening the girls begged to be told what was
the cause of the serious and animated pow-wow. Portentous
looks were all the answer returned while Mrs.
Remington remained in the room.</p>

<p>“Say, who wants to walk to the south end of the
island and watch the tide come in in the moonlight?”
asked Fred, when it was found that his mother expected
to remain in the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
Every one declared they wanted to see such a
sight, and soon the room was vacated and quiet&mdash;Mrs.
Remington being occupied with her written
orders for Mose during her absence.</p>

<p>Once down upon the little beach, Fred announced
that he and the others planned to do lots of things
that his mother wanted done. Such as blasting out
a big rock in the middle of Treasure Cove, raising
a big new flag-pole, and making a pebble walk around
the little log-cabin which was Mrs. Remington’s
sanctuary when she was driven to retirement from the
“madding crowd.”</p>

<p>“She will love that!” exclaimed Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Oh we intend doing lots of other things, too,”
bragged Billy.</p>

<p>“We’re going to cook our own meals over a camp-fire!”
declared Dudley.</p>

<p>“That’s to save Mose the work while you girls are
away!” added Paul.</p>

<p>“Listen to him! Why, you boys eat twice as much
as all of the Islanders together!” scorned Edith.</p>

<p>“Besides, I don’t believe you younger boys can
cook a thing!” came from Elizabeth, doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to eat the stuff you cook!” said
Trixie.</p>

<p>“Fred and Bill know a lot about camp-cooking and
they are going to show Paul and me,” admitted
Dudley.</p>

<p>The idea of having the boys do something to surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
and please Mrs. Remington upon her return,
made Trixie and her girls wish to do something for
Mrs. Charlton. So a conference was held in Elizabeth’s
room to which Anna was invited.</p>

<p>“What <em>do</em> you s’pose Aunt Edith would like most?”
asked Elizabeth after all were seated.</p>

<p>“I know!” cried practical little Edith.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Her flower beds weeded and all that wild grass
dug out of the paths.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” was the disappointed reception of the commonplace
proposition.</p>

<p>“I can wear old gloves, you know,” ventured Trixie.</p>

<p>Her hearers laughed as Trixie’s nails still showed
the result of the earnest efforts of a city polish, of
which she was quite proud.</p>

<p>“Well, we may consider Edith’s plan as a side-work,”
grudged Elizabeth, when no other inspiration
seemed on tap.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington was not permitted to forget her
promise to take everybody on the Medric for a last
farewell to her at the Camp Grounds where the Boston
boat stopped for passengers. Whether it was the
farewell, the sail, or the fun on the mainland that was
the inducement, she wisely refrained from questioning.</p>

<p>“What if it rains!” wondered Edith.</p>

<p>“Oh, we can wear clothes that won’t be damaged
by a drop of rain,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
“Trixie can wear her checked skirt if it’s rain you
want,” plagued Billy.</p>

<p>“Now then, I’ll wear it just for spite!” retorted
Trixie. “I’ll prove to you by the sunshine that the
checks are not a rain jinx!”</p>

<p>Tuesday dawned clear and sunny, therefore proving
Trixie’s statement to be true. The merry party set
out directly after lunch as Mrs. Remington remarked
that the Boston boat was very early at odd times&mdash;especially
so, if one happened to be a little late.</p>

<p>The Medric’s engine helped her “buck” the tide
while Bill remarked, “We sure have got a favourable
puff!”</p>

<p>It was almost low water when they reached the
wharf and the Medric had to be anchored off the landing
while her passengers were set ashore in the tender.</p>

<p>The moment feet were on <em>terra firma</em>, the owners
started for the post office and general store where
candy and cake were sold; but, on the way a tin-typer’s
caravan was found resting by the side of the
main road from the wharf, and the diversion was invaded
and well patronised that day.</p>

<p>The meagre delights of the Camp Ground were soon
exhausted and time hung heavily upon the hands of
the active Islanders. Then Mrs. Remington announced
that the Boston steamer would be an hour
late that day.</p>

<p>“Oh, why did we leave our happy home?” wailed
Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
“Think of all the fun we are missing!” added Paul.</p>

<p>“There are certain joys in a lingering farewell but
I say that some of them are drawn out much too
long!” remarked Fred.</p>

<p>“How! how!” laughed the other boys, and Mrs.
Remington joined even at the expense of her own
feelings.</p>

<p>“The question still remains before us&mdash;what to do
with this extra hour the gods bestowed?” mourned
Elizabeth, who had had visions of Rosemary in the
sunset glow.</p>

<p>“I’ll run over and ask that jitney man who is
watching us as if we were outlaws,” said Fred, starting
off across the road.</p>

<p>The man was very communicative for he had nothing
else to do at the time.</p>

<p>“Thar’s a merry-go-round back over that hill&mdash;it
was runnin’ all mornin’ an’ I guess it’s thar still.”</p>

<p>“Just the thing!” replied Fred, thanking him.</p>

<p>The suggestion met with instant acceptance and
every one started for the hill designated. But a disappointment
awaited them. The merry-go-round was
deserted with the sole exception of a small tow-headed
boy.</p>

<p>However Fred was equal to the emergency. “‘Come
one, come all, these steeds shall run around this track
’til set of sun,’” shouted he, beckoning wildly.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Remington would not allow him to tamper
with the engine or carousel, so she questioned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
small boy who turned out to be the proprietor’s son.</p>

<p>“Now, you run and find your Daddy and tell him
we want two dollars’ worth of rides!” promised Mrs.
Remington.</p>

<p>At the munificent offer the bare-footed urchin
showed a swift and dusty pair of heels to the would-be
riders, and soon returned with both father and
grandfather&mdash;the latter being the patriarch of the
money-till.</p>

<p>“Isn’t this fun! I’ve always wanted to ride on a
merry-go-round!” cried Trixie.</p>

<p>“Maybe you won’t think it fun after a ride!” said
Paul.</p>

<p>“You just watch me and see!” boasted Trixie, smiling.</p>

<p>“I’m going to climb on the animals while we’re
waiting for the man to start up the engine,” proposed
Billy.</p>

<p>“Me for the lion!” shouted Dudley, as he mounted
the king of beasts.</p>

<p>“Paul, let’s ride the white horses side by side and
pretend we’re running a race,” suggested Trixie.</p>

<p>“Bet’che a cookie I’ll beat!” laughed Paul.</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t beat me if these were real horses!
I can ride anything&mdash;even a colt!” teased Trixie.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, that colt of the Captain’s was green and
full of fire&mdash;the Captain says so!” said Paul, defendingly.</p>

<p>The carousel began to turn slowly by this time and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
with many a wheeze and groan, it gathered momentum.
Every one laughed at its slowness at first but
the urging on of their steeds must have infected the
merry-go-round for it soon whirled at a surprising
speed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Remington sat near the old white-bearded
ticket chopper, watching the different expressions on
the children’s faces as the carousel went round.</p>

<p>When the first slow circle was made Trixie had
laughed merrily and cried, “Oh, this is a real joy-ride!”</p>

<p>When it went somewhat faster, she remained silent,
and as she spun around on the horse, passing
Mrs. Remington at rapid intervals, her face looked
grey and her eyes seemed fixed.</p>

<p>“Oh! we surely are going too fast!” gasped she,
finally.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! We’ll go faster than this&mdash;just hold on!”
cheered Paul.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m sure I’m slipping off&mdash;oh, oh!” wailed
Trixie.</p>

<p>“You’re all right&mdash;just stick on!” laughed Paul.</p>

<p>“O-oh&mdash;Paul&mdash;I’m getting so dizzy! I’ll fall!”</p>

<p>“I’ll steady you; here, grab hold of the horse with
your knees and hang on to the iron pole in front!”
advised Paul.</p>

<p>“There goes my hat&mdash;and oh! the old thing has
shaken out all my side-combs!” came from Trixie,
weakly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
“Never mind that&mdash;just hold on!”</p>

<p>“I ca-an-t hold ano-oth-er m-m-min-ute!”</p>

<p>“Keep a stiff upper lip, now, Trix! We’re slowing
down!” encouraged Paul, throwing an arm about the
girl as she swayed uncertainly.</p>

<p>And indeed, the awful whirl did slacken and in a
few more moments, with one last “yawp” the hurdy-gurdy
gave up the spirit&mdash;of music.</p>

<p>Then a very pale and shaky Trixie was lifted from
the race-horse and helped over to a seat beside Mrs.
Remington.</p>

<p>“Oh, wasn’t it <em>awful</em>!” gasped she, shuddering.</p>

<p>“Awful! Why, it was great!” cried Dudley.</p>

<p>“I should say so! Look, I got the brass ring
Trixie! Want it for another try?” asked Billy, generously.</p>

<p>But Trixie thought “discretion to be the better part
of valor.” She knew from actual experience what
a merry-go-round meant so she sat contentedly by and
watched the others whirl.</p>

<p>When even Billy had been sated with the dervish
delight Mrs. Remington led her escorts back to the
wharf where they found Aunt Edith and Aunt Flo-Flo
had arrived from Rosemary by land.</p>

<p>When it was suggested that the girls start back with
Aunt Flo-Flo at once, there was a chorus of protests.</p>

<p>“We’re going to stay as long as anybody&mdash;and say
good-bye,” retorted Elizabeth, fearing she would miss
some fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
The two chiefly concerned in saying farewells
thought this persistence worthy of a greater if not a
better object. But they consented to the delay of the
return party and in its own good time the “City of
Rockland” bore down upon the landing. Then the
young folks had the gratification of positively <em>knowing</em>
by evidence of their own sight, that their guardians
were well out of the way for a time.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>gee!</em> we won’t do a <em>thing</em> while we’re boss!”
sighed Billy, with a great sense of the time before him.</p>

<p>“Some fun&mdash;I should say!” ejaculated Paul, while
Dudley whistled a medley of many tunes and fox-trots
and tangos.</p>

<p>“But the Island Chief rules! Remember!” threatened
Fred.</p>

<p>While on the way to Rosemary, the Islanders discussed
the fact that fine weather broke the hoo-doo
of Trixie’s rain jinx.</p>

<p>“But it hoo-dooed her in another way&mdash;my! but she
was green on that carousel!” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“I never thought Trix could look so sick!” added
Dudley.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t sick a bit! I was only dizzy&mdash;only my
head!” defended Trixie, valiantly.</p>

<p>The boys laughed teasingly and Elizabeth looked off
at the horizon while groping for her poetic medium.</p>

<p>Finally, she turned to Trixie. “It’s a shame to wreck
a perfectly good poem for I love Tennyson dearly, but
the aptness tempts me beyond measure, so here goes!”</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>The classic thus converted by Elizabeth was hailed
with loud acclaim by the boys, but Trixie said never
a word! How the poetess made her “separate peace”
was never told but Trixie was as friendly as ever the
next time the two appeared together.</p>

<p>Wednesday morning at the earliest permissible tide
the Captain and the boys were busy drilling into the
ledge of Treasure Cove. The boys were deeply interested
when they realised that before another tide
flowed over that ledge a blast could be set off. In the
meantime, they went fishing and soon had a fine mess
of cunners for their camp-lunch.</p>

<p>Knowing the extent of the boys’ appetites, Mose’s
tender heart ached in dread of empty stomachs and a
raid on his pantry when he was not at hand to defend
the fort! So he brought a large pan full of biscuits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
and “fixin’s on th’ side” to the cooks. The “fixin’s”
comprising a hearty meal by themselves.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mose, you needn’t to have taken this trouble&mdash;we’re
just going to live a simple life while mother’s
away,” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Yes, you see, Mose, we’re now serving our toasted
bread and baked potatoes. Sit down and have some
with us?” urged Paul.</p>

<p>Mose eyed the charred bread and half-cooked potatoes
and winked at the Captain. “Ah don’ b’lieve Ah
will pa’take ov dis munifercence to-day! But, t’ank
yo’ all d’ same!”</p>

<p>The Captain felt very grateful for Mose for his additions
to the menu, so he added, “Oh, do sit down and
be friendly, Mose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mose, I’m just cookin’ the cunners! They’re
fine!” added Fred.</p>

<p>“Well, seein’ ez Ah fetched a bit from m’ own domain,
Ah don’t min’ ef Ah tas’ some cunners!” sighed
Mose, who was fond of this fish.</p>

<p>As Fred served him a delicious slab of the broiled
fish Mose remarked, “Does tas’ kinder good t’ eat some
odder chef’s cookin’. No t’anks, Billy, Ah don’ guess
Ah’ll have any pertates.”</p>

<p>The boys each took a potato and did their best to
enjoy them but it was not to be! The potatoes were
more than half raw.</p>

<p>“Lemme tell you-all,” said Mose, after the potatoes
had been replaced on the fire, “taters take a heap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
o’ cookin’. Speshully when dey’se big and not cut
up.”</p>

<p>“Bring them here, boys, and I’ll show you what to
do with them,” offered Fred, taking the frying pan
and dropping a chunk of butter in it.</p>

<p>Then the boys watched and soon learned how to
fry good potatoes&mdash;an art many cooks lack.</p>

<p>“Now for the blast!” cried the Captain, when the
dishes and pans had been cleaned with sand and water.</p>

<p>“You boys watch Captain and me fix the fuse and
then when we yell you must run way up on the porch
of mother’s retreat and stand there,” ordered Fred.</p>

<p>The three boys were greatly surprised to see Captain
Ed cut the dynamite with his knife as if it were
a cheese.</p>

<p>“It looks just like a roll of yellow plasticene!” said
Dudley.</p>

<p>“It won’t act like one!” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“You know last year, Captain and Fred blasted out
the boulders for our Council Place and we had to cover
the rocks with logs and things to keep them from flying
through the air and smashing the windows,” explained
Billy, for Paul’s and Dudley’s benefit.</p>

<p>“Oh, did you blast for that Ring?” wondered Paul.</p>

<p>“I should think we did! We have to blast for everything!
There isn’t a level spot on the whole island.
Did you think the pebbles grew so level and smooth on
that Council Place?” laughed Fred.</p>

<p>“I thought it had to be filled in where any hollows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
happened to be but I didn’t know you had to blow off
the bumps!” said Paul, in defence.</p>

<p>That made the Captain laugh, and he now turned
and said: “Run to cover now, boys! I’m goin’ to
light th’ fuse!”</p>

<p>So the boys scrambled up the pathway while Fred
and the Captain lit the fuse and then ran to hide behind
a big spruce. But Paul, curious to note the effect
of that harmless looking cheese, lingered behind the
other boys, thus hoping to get a closer view of the explosion.</p>

<p>Just as the terrific blast rumbled, Fred sighted the
tardy boy. He dashed out, grabbed him roughly,
yanked him back to safety, and then pitched into him.</p>

<p>“Don’t&mdash;you’re hurtin’ me, Fred!” whimpered Paul,
with a better realisation of his danger as the rocks
began raining down upon the spot where he had just
stood.</p>

<p>“You ought to be hurt&mdash;good and plenty, too! Just
so you’ll never do such a fool thing again! I’m Chief
of this Island, I’ll have you to know, and you’ve <em>got
to obey orders</em>!”</p>

<p>Billy and Dudley ran to see what had caused the
quarrel and the Captain, who had seen the rescue, came
over to tell Paul a story as a warning in the future.</p>

<p>“You boys know the light-house just down off
Spruce Island? Well, last year, ol’ Captain Ball was
blastin’ out some rocks in the road near his barn. He
got keerless like at the last and stood too near&mdash;right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
out in the open. And by heck! a chunk of rock as big
as my two fists come plumb down on top of his head
and killed him then and thar! Not a minit t’ think
of what he wanted done ’bout things!”</p>

<p>After an impressive silence the Captain added with
a certain feeling of satisfaction: “But he had a grand
funeral! The finest ever given in these parts. One
of them Dark Harbour millionaires lent the widder his
big private yacht to carry the remains to Metinicus,
where the Cap’n hailed from.</p>

<p>“Seein’ she hadn’t got to pay any costs for shippin’,
Mrs. Ball put all that money in a casket and it was so
fine that it seemed like a shame to put all them silver
handles and satin puffs in the ground.</p>

<p>“Widder Ball invited <em>everybody</em> to make the trip
with the Cap’n an’ most every one accepted the invitation,
too. Thar would have been room on that
yacht fer a few more&mdash;it was that big.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir! That was one grand funeral&mdash;what with
red plush curtains and willow arm-chairs everywhere!
And a dining-room fixed up with painted dishes and
sparklin’ glass! I sometimes wish how old Cap’n Ball
oughter know about that trip&mdash;he would have felt better
where he is, I’m sure!”</p>

<p>The boys had listened to the sudden ending of Captain
Ball’s career without due respect for dynamite and
Captain Ed, finding Paul had not been thoroughly
frightened by his tale, drove it well home.</p>

<p>“But <em>you</em> wouldn’t have a good time like Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Ball! You’d be sent home in a box and no yacht and
crowd of folks to sail to your funeral! So, just keep
behind a tree after this!”</p>

<p>Paul suddenly realised how lonely he must feel if
he was instantly killed by a rock and freighted all the
way from Maine to New Jersey, and he felt contrite
and humble for a full hour after the incident closed.</p>

<p>The rest of the afternoon was given to preparing
an old spar for the flag-pole. It was about thirty feet
in length so that all the boys worked at the same time
in sand-papering and polishing the wood.</p>

<p>“Next time I go over to the Cove I’ll have the blacksmith
make a collar to go around the mast-head, and
then we’ll have it all ready for the raisin’ bee before
your mother comes back.”</p>

<p>“We want everything done and waiting so all we
have to do when she comes is to hoist the flag,” added
Billy.</p>

<p>The following day Uncle Tom came over and announced
that he was ready to start the rifle-range and
teach the boys how to handle a gun.</p>

<p>“Did they say we could?” asked Paul, eagerly, his
desire to obey in certain ways, tinctured by the tale
about Captain Ball.</p>

<p>“Yes, the committee reported favorably providing
that I would keep watch of you all and never let you
get reckless!”</p>

<p>So, the boys painted a large target on a packing
case and set it up against a rock where a clear range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
could be had. Uncle Tom chose a spot where no danger
to passing boatmen could be incurred.</p>

<p>The spy-glass was trained upon the target and each
boy was allowed five shots each turn. The use of the
glass obviated the many tiresome trips to and from the
target to count the score for every boy.</p>

<p>Only between the turns did the Captain go to the
board and put a dab of paint on the marks made by
each boy. During these intervals no one was allowed
to load or handle a gun.</p>

<p>Captain Ed made a splendid score with Fred’s Marlin
38&ndash;55 but Paul and Dudley took a long time to get
the proper range and sight. Their bullets cut into
the ledges right and left so that the Captain laughed
heartily.</p>

<p>“When we need more blastin’ done there’s no use
wastin’ money for dynamite&mdash;we’ll jus’ ask you two
boys to aim at Treasure Cove and your fire will blow
off the top of the ledges!”</p>

<p>The others tittered but were too much engaged to
care much whether the Captain joshed them or not.
Then, Fred, who stood at the spy-glass called, “A hit
for Paul!”</p>

<p>That spurred Dudley to better work so when it came
his turn to try he took great pains to aim carefully and
was rewarded by seeing the splinters fly from the
packing-case.</p>

<p>Evening came all too soon for the joy of firing real
rifles was intoxicating to the boys. They begged Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
Tom to be sure and come over every day, as early
in the morning as he could get away.</p>

<p>“Oh, but I’m scheduled to take the girls out on some
of these days,” he protested. “However, I’ll try to
get in some regular practising hours with you boys.”</p>

<p>The rifle-range was almost forgotten the next morning
when Captain Ed brought in the mail. An answer
from Mr. Remington to Billy’s plea for the launch,
authorised him to “Go ahead and get it if the Captain
says it is all right!”</p>

<p>As that necessitated an immediate exodus from the
island, an eager pilgrimage started for the little landing
near Saturday Cove, where lay the coveted craft
at her moorings.</p>

<p>To the disinterested eye she seemed old and shabby,
to say nothing of dirt. To Billy, however, she was
a vision of beauty and a promise of joy. The ex-owner
took the lad for a trial spin so that he could
learn the tricks of the little engine.</p>

<p>Billy disdained the tow offered by Captain Ed and
insisted upon returning under his own power. Not for
nothing had he watched and helped for weeks with the
Captain’s engines, hoping for the day when he should
be captain of his own launch.</p>

<p>That same night, as they lounged about Fred’s teepee,
the Chief made a suggestion.</p>

<p>“Now that Cap’n Bill has a launch suppose we make
an aqua-plane? We might start it to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
The idea was met with delighted “Hows!” and in
the morning all started on the carpenter’s job.</p>

<p>The plane completed, the boys felt such a pride in
the work that they longed for some one to admire it.
Besides, they had to have an audience when they aqua-planed.
So it came about, that all of the girls and
Aunt Flo-Flo were invited to a bathing party with
aqua-planing on the side.</p>

<p>The boys drank greedily of the admiration freely
poured out by the girls as they stood about the plane.
Finally, the girls were invited to try it.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it awfully hard to manage?” asked Trixie.</p>

<p>“Not much harder than that wooden horse on the
merry-go-round,” teased Paul.</p>

<p>“Even if you should fall off you can swim, you
know,” added Billy.</p>

<p>“I’ll let Elizabeth try it first,” generously allowed
Trixie.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was a splendid swimmer and nothing on
or in water could daunt her, so Billy was soon towing
her along after his launch.</p>

<p>“Gee! That’s pretty good, Lizzie&mdash;for a girl, I
mean!” conceded Billy, as he admired the way she
stood upright and managed the plane.</p>

<p>“You needn’t have added that last&mdash;‘for a girl’; just
remember please, that I learned to swim at a much
younger age than you ever did!” retorted Elizabeth,
ruffled at the hated nick-name.</p>

<p>Then, when every one had tried the aqua-plane Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Flo-Flo had something to say. “Won’t you boys come
over to Rosemary and hold a Council for some friends
of mine?”</p>

<p>What with rifle shooting, aqua-planing, and other
intense delights, the boys were not as enthusiastic as
usual.</p>

<p>“We’re going to have piles of ice-cream and delicious
cakes&mdash;to say nothing of other good things,”
hinted Elizabeth, her superior knowledge of boys
standing her in good stead.</p>

<p>“We-ll&mdash;seeing that you all want a Council so
much, maybe we can manage,” said Billy, looking at
the other boys.</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;when?” hastily accepted Aunt Flo-Flo.</p>

<p>“I s’pose Mose will freeze some cream for us as
usual on Sunday and Thursday so we’d better say
Tuesday, as that gives us ice-cream on an off day,” interjected
Paul, before any one could decide.</p>

<p>“All right! Then we can go marketing to Belfast
on Monday, and spend Tuesday at Rosemary,” said
Fred.</p>

<p>The Tuesday for the Council was a lovely day and
Paul took a snap-shot of Aunt Flo-Flo and her visitors.
The Nature <em>coups</em> were claimed by Elizabeth and the
three younger boys. Then Trixie formally presented
a red scalp to the Black Bears and Elizabeth followed
suit. Paul and Dudley also paid their forfeited locks
so that Fred and Bill had a number of brilliant
trophies hanging from their belts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Finally, the much-longed-for ice-cream was brought
and the pyramids piled up on the boys’ plates received
sincere applause and attention.</p>

<p>Among the cakes passed around were certain cookies
that the boys preferred to any others. So good
were they, that Billy remarked, “My! But these are
the best ever!”</p>

<p>“Who do you think baked them?” asked Trixie,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not you, anyway!” laughed he.</p>

<p>“Well, Smarty, <em>we</em> did! Elizabeth and I made the
batter and Edith cut them out and put them in the
pans.”</p>

<p>“Hoh! That’s nothing! <em>We</em> cook whole meals at
our camp!” exclaimed Paul.</p>

<p>“Yes siree! Say, boys, how about that breakfast
yesterday, eh?” boasted Dudley.</p>

<p>“Umph! You ought to have tasted <em>that</em>! Billy
went over to Islesboro in his launch and shot five red
squirrels. We skinned and broiled them for breakfast
and maybe they weren’t good!” said Fred, abetting
the younger boys.</p>

<p>“What else did you have?” queried Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Fred baked some pancakes and we ate, and ate,
and ate!” asserted Paul, looking at his companions.</p>

<p>“I never saw any one eat so much as they did, except
at our clam-bakes,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe you <em>baked</em> the pan-cakes but Mose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
was there to advise and start that breakfast going!”
asserted Trixie.</p>

<p>“Who told you so?” cried a number of voices.</p>

<p>“We just went over to get something Elizabeth
wanted from the Island and you were all gone to
Adamses for milk. Mose told us about the squirrels
and the funny mistakes you boys made while experimenting
on them. And he told us of the towers of
pancakes you boys made way with, too.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, we haven’t had our annual clam-bake
yet?” hastily declared Billy.</p>

<p>“That’s so! As soon as mother comes home we
must try and get it started,” added Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, Trix, we have the most wonderful time at
these bakes!” exclaimed Billy, rolling his eyes and patting
his stomach.</p>

<p>So, in talking and planning for the clam-bake, the
thin ice of camp-cooking was forgotten and the character
of the boys for being first-class chefs was not
completely ruined.</p>

<h2><a name="xii" id="xii"></a>CHAPTER TWELVE<br />
<small>THE PIRATES OF SCILLY LEDGE</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap"><span class="dropcap2">“</span>S</span>AY, Fred, did you see the Boston steamer go
past this morning?” asked Billy, wonderingly, one
day.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, I didn’t!”</p>

<p>“Neither did I,” said Dudley.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” added Paul.</p>

<p>“It gets to be such a habit when the boats go past&mdash;up
in the morning and down at night&mdash;that their absence
is quite noticeable,” said Fred.</p>

<p>But the boys forgot about the failure of the big
white steamer to put in her appearance as usual. That
afternoon, they were out with the Captain when a
fisherman from Saturday Cove hailed them.</p>

<p>“Hey! Cap’n! Th’ Ol’ Katahdin’s gone ashore on
Scilly Ledge, this mornin’!”</p>

<p>“You don’t tell!” cried the astonished Captain.</p>

<p>“That’s why we didn’t see her go by!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“Can they get her off?” Fred shouted after the informer.</p>

<p>“Nah&mdash;they tells me she’s a total wrack!”</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other while the same desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
sprang up in each heart&mdash;to visit that wreck!</p>

<p>“Can’t we go down and see her, Captain?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s purty far out to sea&mdash;off Monhegan;
and, besides, the ground swell’s bad there,” hesitated
Captain Ed.</p>

<p>“Captain, if Aunt Miriam will lend us the Zeus and
Benton goes along, don’t you s’pose it will be all
right!” urged Fred.</p>

<p>The Captain had hard work hiding his own desire
to go, being stirred by inherited beach-combing tendencies.
Hence, he agreed to the exciting plan.</p>

<p>Without the loss of any time, the boys sailed over
to Isola Bella and in a pleading manner broached the
subject to their aunt. They must not seem too eager
or the trip too exciting or she would refuse her consent.</p>

<p>Rumour had travelled swiftly so that Captain Benton
had heard and also was stirred by the spirits of
his ancestors to visit that wreck! Hence, he thought
it was perfectly safe and a most delightful excursion
for the boys to take!</p>

<p>Early the next morning, therefore, the launch set
out for old Scilly Ledge. Down past Camden, around
Owl’s Head, through the narrow Mussel Ridges Channel,
past White Head and out to open sea, steered the
Captain of the Zeus!</p>

<p>Well for the boys that the big launch was the seaworthy
craft that she was. Before they caught sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
of the doomed steamer the ground swell had gotten
in its deadly work. Three seasick lads lay limply on
the cushions feeling that the Zeus was going down
never to climb again, as she dropped into the hollows
between the swells.</p>

<p>Soon, however, as she rose on the crest of each great
wave, the stirring sight of hundreds of craft converging
with the Zeus to a common centre, revived the
drooping spirits of the boys and the “green” sensations
gradually disappeared.</p>

<p>“She must be abandoned, all right!” remarked Captain
Ed.</p>

<p>“’Tain’t curiosity what brings all them craft here,”
hinted Captain Benton.</p>

<p>The boys pricked up their ears. What did the Captains
mean?</p>

<p>“I always knew them Metinicus an’ Isle of Holt fellers
were pirates at heart!” sneered Captain Ed.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, it ain’t stealin’&mdash;not exactly, you
know!” argued Benton.</p>

<p>“Oh sure not! Flotsam and jetsam’s anybuddy’s
pickin’s, and she’s all ensured anyhow,” conceded Captain
Ed.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say that all these folks are here
to grab something from that steamer?” cried Fred,
aghast.</p>

<p>“That’s just it!” replied the Captain.</p>

<p>“Oo-oh! if that isn’t stealing in the eye of the law,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
why can’t we pick up something too&mdash;just a souvenir,
you know!” ventured Billy, breathlessly.</p>

<p>By this time, they were drawing closer to the wreck.
Careened over, rolling and crunching in the heavy
swells, the Katahdin was too dangerous for close quarters,
and in fact, that was the only thing that kept the
circling boats at a distance from her.</p>

<p>The greed of the watchers was stimulated by the
stray bits of wreckage that were seen swashing around,
and so contagious is the desire to get something for
nothing, especially when the law smiles leniently upon
the pirate, that the boys and Captains in the Zeus
otherwise peaceable law-abiding Americans, now felt
the maddening frenzy to secure a prize, too.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a fiercer gust of wind and a seventh wave
struck the hapless boat at the same time raising her
up only to crash her down amidships on the back-bone
of Old Scilly. With a rending and splitting heard
above the roar of the breakers, the steamer broke in
two and began to vomit forth her cargo.</p>

<p>After that pandemonium reigned. The boys could
never tell just when they, too, turned into lawless pirates!</p>

<p>In the wild scramble for the floating cases from the
hold of the steamer, many a launch and boat had the
bows stove in. Free fights ensued and the butts of
oars were used with telling effect on the heads of others.
Of course, the Zeus did not engage in this warfare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
but she soon was piled high with a miscellaneous
freight.</p>

<p>As for the prizes contained in that cargo, it wasn’t
a time to pick and choose, but a case of “grab and
get” before it sank from sight.</p>

<p>A crate floated near the boys and piercing squeals
from the inside drew the attention of the pirates of
the Zeus to it.</p>

<p>“It’s a pig!” cried Dudley.</p>

<p>“Oh, let’s rescue it before it drowns,” called Paul.</p>

<p>When the captains and Fred Anally succeeded in
hauling the heavy crate inboard, poor piggy’s squeals
had ceased.</p>

<p>“Let’s use ‘first aid’ on it!” exclaimed Billy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“He’s a fine-looking shoat, all right,” commented
Benton.</p>

<p>“Let’s wrench off the slats on top and get him out
He’ll take up less room uncrated,” suggested Captain
Ed.</p>

<p>“We can try ‘first aid’ on him, then,” giggled Paul.</p>

<p>As the crate was opened and piggy removed, Billy
said: “I bet he was a prize pig for the Belfast Fair.”</p>

<p>“Here, Captain, let us look at the address on the
crate and see where he was going!” exclaimed Fred.</p>

<p>But no ink mark was left on the case and the tag
that had been tacked to the wood was soaked off by the
water. So the rescuing party were none the wiser
after the examination.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
“Well, roast pig ain’t to be sneezed at, anyway,”
said Benton.</p>

<p>But just then, piggy revived and slipped from Benton’s
hold. He started a circus in the launch with all
hands trying to catch him, and more than once, the
boys very nearly fell into the water in their mad
scramble to grab him. Finally, the unruly passenger
was cornered and “hog-tied.”</p>

<p>“We’ll give him to Uncle Tom, because none of us
Islanders can use him,” suggested Fred.</p>

<p>And so piggy was destined to find a temporary resting
place on the farm at Rosemary.</p>

<p>It had taken three hours to sail down to Old Scilly
Ledge and it was long past lunch-time before the excited
pirates thought of anything so commonplace as
eating!</p>

<p>A large broken box of fancy biscuits reminded them
that they could feel hungry now that the first excitement
was over, and the sandwiches Mose had packed
in the lunch soon disappeared. The erstwhile seasick
boys, being hollow clean down to their toes, caused
the lunch to melt away like ice in a hot sun. Then
followed the slightly soggy and salted crackers.</p>

<p>With sighs of regrets, the two captains then suggested
that they turn for the homeward trip,</p>

<p>“Oh, just one more haul!” cried Billy, spearing for
a floating case near at hand.</p>

<p>“Where can you find room to stack any more?”
asked Benton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
“Oh, this is a case of biscuits&mdash;fancy mixed, too!”
exclaimed Billy, having guided the prize to the side
of the launch.</p>

<p>Without demur, the case of crackers was brought
inboard and then Fred called out: “There’s a little
box floating away from us&mdash;‘precious goods come in
small packages,’ you know, so we ought to get that!”</p>

<p>“Another feller’s after it&mdash;quick&mdash;hurry up!” cried
Paul.</p>

<p>The pirates on the Zeus won the race and the small
half-submerged box was carefully lifted aboard.</p>

<p>“<em>Now</em>, I insist that we start home!” declared Captain
Ed.</p>

<p>“Even as it is we won’t get there until after dark!”
added Benton.</p>

<p>“Never mind, we’ve done a big day’s work!”
chuckled Fred.</p>

<p>“I should say so! Gee! pigs, crackers, and whatnot!”
added Billy, gloatingly.</p>

<p>“Ed, I bet those vultures won’t leave a stick on that
boat&mdash;why, every little shack down the bay will have
one of them red-plush chairs from the saloon, and
every one on Metinicus will be sleepin’ on good mattresses&mdash;after
they’re dried out,” grumbled Benton.</p>

<p>On the way home the boys investigated their treasure
trove. The small box that had caused such a
lively race was found to contain a gross of Ingersol
watches. But most of them were utterly spoiled from
the salt-water bath. The better ones, packed individually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
in small close-fitting cases, proved to be in fairly
good condition.</p>

<p>Oh, what joy to the hearts of these mariners! To
hear the ticking of a watch on every passenger of the
Zeus&mdash;a watch that might be consulted as often as one
liked without regard to the others!</p>

<p>“Here’s the last one of the good lot; what shall we
do with it?” asked Dudley.</p>

<p>“Tie it around the porker’s neck!” laughed Paul.</p>

<p>“Oh, no! Let’s take it home to Mose; he will be
tickled to pieces with it,” exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>So the little box was tucked in Billy’s pocket to be
given to the appreciative cook. Then the boys turned
over another case.</p>

<p>“Here boys!&mdash;don’t open up anything else, or the
clutter will choke the engine!” begged Benton.</p>

<p>They laughed at that but promised to wait for landing
before investigating any further.</p>

<p>That night, the Islanders passed a delirious time
amidst the contents of the cases picked up from the
Katahdin.</p>

<p>The first case opened was found to be packed with
woodenware&mdash;bread boards, chopping-bowls, potato
mashers, and such.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Here’s enough wood to build a
house!” said Paul.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what! These oval and round bread-boards’ll
make dandy totems for every one!” cried
Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
“That’s what they will; and the mashers will do for
the tom-toms when we hold Council,” added Dudley.</p>

<p>“Now don’t be silly&mdash;you know there wouldn’t be
any drum head left in the tom-tom if you boys beat
time with one of those wooden potato-mashers,” said
Fred, trying to pry off a slat.</p>

<p>“Where’re you going?” asked Paul of Billy, who
had piled an armful high with wooden dishes.</p>

<p>“Give ’em to Mose&mdash;he needed some new kitchenware!”</p>

<p>At that, Paul and Dudley each caught up a wooden
bowl and a wooden masher and marched after Billy,
beating time for his steps.</p>

<p>“Hey, Mose! Here’s your answer to prayer! I
heard you, last week, saying that you hoped the good
Lord would send you some kitchen dishes mighty
quick!” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“Ah no&mdash;’deed no, chile! Mose neber prayed no
wicked pray’r lak dat&mdash;mebbe dat wreck coul’ be laid
t’ de doah ov such a pray’r! And Mose sure ain’t
guilty of <em>dat</em>! But, what Ah did say was ‘Ah wisht
de dear Lord woul’ take pity on poor Mose an’ sen’
him some dishes mighty quick! Dere’s a heap ov diffrunce,”
explained the devout cook.</p>

<p>“Well, forget the prayer that caused the wreck, and
come in to see what else we got,” teased Dudley, at
last.</p>

<p>Mose was only too pleased to be invited to assist at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
the prize packages but he looked askance at the debris
that covered the floor of the bungalow.</p>

<p>“Why diden’ yo’ all wait f’ mornin’ to unpack dis
mussy stuff out on d’ groun’?”</p>

<p>“Wait! My goodness, we could hardly wait to get
through supper!” exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>While they were talking the Captain brought in another
case which he had wheeled up from the launch.
This case must have been consigned to a hardware
merchant or some poultry man as it was filled with wire
nests for chickens.</p>

<p>“This sure is a lottery,” laughed Fred.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we lost out on this draw!” chuckled Captain
Ed.</p>

<p>“Well, these can’t be used anyway, ’cause we never
keep chickens on the Island,” said Billy, regretfully.</p>

<p>“You might take them over to your Uncle Tom,”
ventured Paul.</p>

<p>“He won’t need more than three or four&mdash;and look
at all of these,” replied Fred.</p>

<p>“How many do you s’pose there are,” wondered
Dudley, and Billy began to unwire one bundle. As
he took out one after another of the closely packed
wire frames the boys counted until they found there
were twenty-five in a pack.</p>

<p>“Say, for pity’s sake don’t unwire any more&mdash;there’s
twenty bundles of them in all,” laughed the
Captain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
“That’s five hundred wire baskets! Gee! We’d be
swamped all right!” added Billy.</p>

<p>“We’ll give all the farmers on the mainland and
Islesboro some,” said Paul.</p>

<p>“We might make a good trade on them for eggs and
butter!” remarked the business man of the crowd.</p>

<p>“Ha, ha! Mose allus said Bill woul’ be a milyunair
some day,” laughed the cook.</p>

<p>“I tell you what we might do with some of ’em!”
now suggested the Captain, thoughtfully. “Last summer,
I had some old ones that I threw out and my wife
filled them with moss and loam, and then planted some
sorts of ferns in ’em. When they were wired and
hung up on the porch, they looked mighty fine, I can
tell you!”</p>

<p>“Great! That’s just what we’ll do for a surprise.
We’ll hang them all around the bungalow for mother!”
cried Billy.</p>

<p>“And make a lot for Aunt Miriam for lending us
the Zeus,” added Fred.</p>

<p>“We can go to Sprague’s Cove and dig up some of
those swell ferns&mdash;and there are whole carpets of thick
moss there,” said Billy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Then we’ve found a use for the nests!” sighed
Paul, who feared to find any stock on hand valueless.</p>

<p>The next case was filled with stationers’ assorted
goods. Alas! the briny had done its worst here. The
pens, knife-blades and wire paper-holders were already
rusting and besides that a peculiar glutinous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
slime covered the articles in the case. It was this
same sour odour that, coming from the inside of the
case had first attracted the boys’ attention to the box
when the Captain brought it in.</p>

<p>“Wire baskets! Gee, do we need any more?” asked
Dudley, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“What’s all this gooey slime!” wondered Paul, disgusted
with the mess he got all over his hands as he
tried to pull out a package.</p>

<p>As the boys delved deeper into the case and brought
out boxes and stationery all patterned by red and blue
and black ink which had soaken through from broken
bottles, they found the horrid smelly jelly diluted by
salt water, to have mixed in with everything else.</p>

<p>“Ah! the mystery’s solved!” cried Fred, lifting a
broken carton of paste-powder from the case.</p>

<p>“Agh! It’s got ready-made in the ocean and spread
itself wherever it was not wanted!” said Paul, with
disgust.</p>

<p>“Lemme take care ob dat goo-case!” offered Mose.
“Ah kin clean ’em all out in d’ mawnin’ an’ mebbe
fin’ a heap of paper so’s Paul an’ Dudley kin write
home every week, reg’lar!”</p>

<p>“All right&mdash;let Mose do it!” laughed Billy.</p>

<p>“But Ah’m tellin’ yo’ right heah&mdash;ef Ah see a nice
pen-knife wid a white pearl han’le Ah sure will tek
it fo’ pay!”</p>

<p>“Anything you find, Mose! Go as far as you like!”
promised Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Mose left the cutlery in kerosene over night thereby
cleaning off the rust and polishing up the items. The
paper and other passably good articles he cleaned off
fairly well and kept them on hand for the children
to use.</p>

<p>The last of the cases contained dire disappointment.
The groceries therein were discovered to be utterly
ruined&mdash;salt, sugar, cereals, coffee and other foodstuffs.</p>

<p>“Now I’m glad we stopped and got that last case of
crackers,” declared Dudley.</p>

<p>“So’m I!” added Paul, hiding a wide yawn behind
a case.</p>

<p>“Is this all now!” demanded Billy.</p>

<p>“All for to-night, I guess,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“Gee! but I’m glad! I’m dog-tired!” sighed Billy.</p>

<p>“We all are&mdash;let’s get to bed!” cried Paul.</p>

<p>The next day, the Isola Bella and Rosemary contingent
came early to hear all about the piratical raid
on the seas about Scilly Ledge; and the boys relived
again their thrilling adventures in relating them to
their interested audience.</p>

<p>The story told, Mose appeared with lemonade and
crackers.</p>

<p>“Oh, just the thing! Ladies, won’t you partake of
our Pirate’s Prize brand of biscuits? Sultanas filled
with ocean currents and genuine Saltines fresh from
the Katahdin!” joked Fred, bowing.</p>

<p>Of course the ladies laughed and while they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
munched the crackers the boys spoke of the hanging
baskets they expected to have ready soon.</p>

<p>“Oh, and by the way, boys, Uncle Tom told me to
be sure and thank you for the pig although he was
quite overwhelmed at first. Fancy, having a nice fat
pig fished out of the ocean for you!” exclaimed Aunt
Edith.</p>

<p>“He’s going to keep it, isn’t he?” anxiously asked
Paul.</p>

<p>“Oh, certainly&mdash;for a time, anyway. We have
called it Katahdin, for it proved its undisputed right
to the name by making such free use of the last syllable
in the name!”</p>

<p>This amused the boys tremendously and they felt
relieved to find that Uncle Tom had gladly accepted
the foundling.</p>

<p>“Speaking of fern baskets&mdash;where are you going for
the ferns?” asked Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“We thought of going to Sprague’s Cove for them,”
replied Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, do take us with you then,” cried Miriam.</p>

<p>“Yes, Fred, do! Then I can go off on a little hunting
trip by myself?” said Billy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“As long as you don’t shoot anywhere near us, it
will suit me,” warned Fred.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll keep a mile or more away&mdash;anyway, you
know I am not Paul or Dudley, who hit a mark at
right-angles to their target!” teased Billy.</p>

<p>So the girls were permitted to go on the cruise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
help dig up some of the beautiful ferns and wonderful
moss found at Sprague’s Cove. A keg full of leaf
mould was also taken for the nourishment of the roots
of the ferns.</p>

<p>Meantime, Billy planned to land at Adams’ Beach
and hunt for rabbits and red squirrels, but before he
quite reached the shore he saw a black dog-like head
glide through the water. It dove! But it reappeared
again and Billy stopped the engine of his launch.</p>

<p>Quietly he waited, for he knew the curiosity of the
seal would draw it nearer and perhaps, in range of his
rifle. He took great care not to show the gun and
thus stood waiting.</p>

<p>His knowledge of the habits of the Harbour seal
proved to be correct for the smooth dark head popped
up quite near the bow of the launch.</p>

<p>He fired but the seal sank, leaving a pool of blood
on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>Billy knew that he had lost his prey unless it was
lying in shallow enough water for him to retrieve it:
for a dead seal sinks like lead.</p>

<p>He slowly motored over to the place where the red
tinge was now mingling with the water, and sounded
carefully with an oar.</p>

<p>“Oh, joy! I guess I can get him!” cried Billy to
himself as the oar touched bottom at about six feet
depth.</p>

<p>“It’s high water now, too, and that’s lucky for me!”
he soliloquised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
When the water had cleared, Billy plainly saw the
dead seal lying on a ledge. He pondered the situation
well, then decided to wait and watch the seal, for
he feared that with the wash of the ebb-tide he would
never find it again if he left the place. When the returning
“moss-backs” came in sight with their launch
he would hail them to come and help him.</p>

<p>Finally, the chugging of the engine was heard and
Billy hailed the Captain and Fred.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a seal&mdash;come and help me get him!” yelled
Billy, contradictorily.</p>

<p>With the Captain and Fred aiding, Billy used the
oar to push a slip-noose under and around the seal’s
tail and hauled it up to the surface. With considerable
labour it was pulled on board but its bleeding
head was left hanging over the side of the launch.</p>

<p>Once at the Island the seal was hauled up on the
rocks and Billy started in to skin it. Uncle Tom came
for the girls before this work had been completed and
they waved hands at the busy boy, shouting as they
left the float-stage:</p>

<p>“Good riddance to the seal! We’re not sorry to
leave that awful smell. Why, the whole Island is permeated
with it!”</p>

<p>“’Tis rather sickenin’, isn’t it?” grinned Billy, standing
up to stretch his lame back. “It’s just as well
mother isn’t here now!”</p>

<p>The next few days were devoted by Billy and Fred
to the curing and tanning of the seal-skin. It was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
easy job, either! The scraping alone occupied many
hours but nothing seemed like too much trouble for
such a trophy!</p>

<p>“Billy, did you know there’s a bounty on the Harbour
seals?” asked Captain Ed, one morning. “If
you just take the chin whiskers to the Post Office at
Sabbath Day Harbour they’ll give you a dollar for
them.”</p>

<p>“Me for that dollar!” declared Billy. So that
afternoon Captain Ed handed Billy a written statement
for evidence that the boy caught the seal.</p>

<p>The next day the boys made another trip to Islesboro
and much to the young Nimrod’s satisfaction
the dollar was forthcoming without delay.</p>

<p>“There won’t be any seals left a few years from
now,” remarked the elderly postmaster to Billy.</p>

<p>“Wall, they come near to ruin’ the salmon-fisheries
and somethin’ had to be done about ’em,” added a
sailor-man.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir!” said a fisherman who lounged near the
door. “I’ve seen a salmon-weir just hung full of salmon-heads&mdash;all
that them seals left the fishermen!”</p>

<p>“But I always kind’a liked the seals and it’s a pity
they has to be killed off,” said the postmaster sympathetically.</p>

<p>A scornful glance from the fisherman and a sniff
from the sailor were the only answers vouchsafed the
remark.</p>

<p>Fred and Billy finished the work on the seal that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
day, and the next morning the Captain said he had the
collar ready for the flag-pole.</p>

<p>The boys helped him with the work and when all
was ready the snowy staff was successfully raised.
Now, every one was eager to see the flag wave from
the top but they had agreed to wait for their mother’s
home-coming. To divert their attention, the Captain
made a suggestion.</p>

<p>“Who’s goin’ to help me whip the ends of the new
cable for the Medric, sailor-fashion?”</p>

<p>So they worked gaily at this for a time, but what
boy can handle a fine piece of rope and resist the excitement
of having a swing?</p>

<p>“Captain, lend us your new rope for a while?” asked
Billy.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I have a plan for a dandy swing and besides, it
will take the ‘lay’ out of your cable,” replied Billy,
diplomatically.</p>

<p>The Captain chuckled and consented&mdash;indeed, he offered
to help the boys secure the ends but they knew
they could manage.</p>

<p>The swing proved to be all Billy had hoped for it.
In fact, so thrilling was the experiences of that swing,
that the Captain regretted his co-operation for he felt
there lurked too much risk to life and limb while it
was being used. Hence, he claimed the right to take
it the following day for the Medric. But how the
boys did enjoy it while it lasted!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Billy demurred vehemently as Captain Ed said he
had to use the cable so the Captain craftily hinted:
“You ain’t been over to Rosemary after them porcupines,
yet? I s’pose your Uncle Tom’s orchard is near
about spoiled by now!”</p>

<p>“Gee! That’s so! I ought to go after them at
once!”</p>

<p>“I have to go over to the Cove for supplies&mdash;Mose
is forever wantin’ a yeast-cake, it seems! You might
go with me and stay all night at your Uncle Tom’s and
come back to-morrow with a fine quill-pig, eh?” continued
the subtle Captain.</p>

<p>Mose stood by watching the boys swing and he
heard the conversation. He grinned for he knew the
Captain’s tactics well. But he took a certain pride in
the looks of his Islanders.</p>

<p>“Chile, yo’ sure mus’ change dem old duds ef yo’
goin’ to mek a visit! Ah ain’t goin’ t’ low you’ Maw’s
son t’ look lak a sure-’nough tramp! Yo’ ha’r needs
trimmin’, too!”</p>

<p>“Oh pshaw, Mose, what difference does it make?
It will be night and I’m going huntin’ so no one will
see me!” argued Billy.</p>

<p>“Hush yo’ complain’ now, Bill! Come in an’ min’
yo gardeen!” laughed Mose, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“Go on, Billy, you know he’s right! Rosemary is
not a camp and who knows who’ll be visiting there?
You’d disgrace us and your relations if you were seen
in the duds that came out of the ‘Ark’!” declared Fred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
Billy realised he was in the minority on this vote
so he submitted to Mose’s barbering but with much
grumbling.</p>

<p>“Such a lot of fussing for a hunting trip!” he observed,
but the hair-cutter paid no attention to the
complaint just then as he had his mind full of other
plans.</p>

<p>“Whiles Ah’ve got m’ ban’ in th’ barber business all
yo’ boys come along t’ dis ha’r-dressin’ parloh&mdash;lates’
style cuts!”</p>

<p>“Ouch! that was my ear. Darn your latest style
cuts!” cried Billy impatiently.</p>

<p>“Wuz dat yo’ eah, Chile? Shore ’nuff-dey seems
to grow jus’ lak yo’ ha’r! Ah disremembered dey
wuz so big, an’ dat ho’come Ah teched ’em wif d’
shears!”</p>

<p>A laugh followed this joke on Billy and that young
man departed to dress in a ruffled frame of mind.</p>

<p>The next morning about nine o’clock Paul discovered
the Captain and Billy coming toward the Island
in the chugging boat. He called to the other boys
and they all ran down to Treasure Cove to meet the
two sailors.</p>

<p>On the launch stood Billy grinning his widest and
holding aloft a porcupine. As he came within hearing
he shouted: “Oh, it’s a cinch to catch porcupines!
Never got anything so dead easy! Uncle Tom shot
one, too,” grandly.</p>

<p>After coming ashore, the Captain handed Fred a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
letter which bore the Boston post-mark and began
“How Kolah Wita-tonkan.”</p>

<p>The others stood at hand to hear any possible news
from Mrs. Remington, and Fred hastily perused the
pages.</p>

<p>“Well! I’ll be bliffed! Mother writes that she met
Mrs. Baker and Mrs. Hubert in Boston and they are
all going to take a motor trip from their camp up
through Maine.”</p>

<p>“Are they coming here?” queried Billy, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Later, maybe. Mother says she invited them all
to come and spend a day with us on the Island, and
they seemed quite taken with the idea.”</p>

<p>“Does she say whether any of the girls or boys will
be with them on the trip?” asked Dudley.</p>

<p>“Maybe my sister Hilda will be with them!” added
Paul.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, because mother merely says they were
attending a suffrage convention in Boston&mdash;you know
what ardent members both Mrs. Baker and Mrs. Hubert
are? And they had a nice long talk, but nothing
more is said in this letter,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“I wish the doctor would come&mdash;he’s awfully good
fun!” said Billy.</p>

<p>“We won’t know until mother gets home, then she’ll
tell us all about it.”</p>

<p>“Then we could have that swell clam-bake, eh?”
said Paul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
“Do you know, we’ve got ten big lobsters in the
car now! I’ll bet we will have a lot more by the time
mother gets home,” exclaimed Billy.</p>

<p>This hope spurred the boys to even greater efforts
to bait the traps enticingly, and “tend out” for results.</p>

<h2><a name="xiii" id="xiii"></a>CHAPTER THIRTEEN<br />
<small>THIEVES IN THE NIGHT</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ILLY had a habit of waking about dawn and
stepping out of his tent to look around and
gauge the weather for the day. So, it happened about
three o’clock one morning, that he indulged in his usual
nocturnal survey.</p>

<p>The bay was calm in that still dark hour before
dawn. Bill was about to retire after making his prognostications
when the muffled chugging of a motor-launch
and the sound of a boat bumping against something
in the back bay off the float-stage, instantly rendered
him alert.</p>

<p>He knew the Islanders were wrapped in slumber
so he investigated, creeping down under cover of the
firs to a vantage point near the shore.</p>

<p>It was too dark to see anything, but the muffled
sounds convinced Billy that somebody was “monkeying”
with their precious lobsters.</p>

<p>Quietly he stole back and woke the Captain and the
boys. With many cautions for silence, they slipped
into trousers and sweaters, thrust feet into sneakers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
and rushed to surprise the marauders&mdash;Billy not forgetting
his rifle.</p>

<p>The unavoidable sounds made by the Islanders in
leaving the float-stage were warning enough, so before
they were well off in Billy’s launch the strange
craft was flying toward the south.</p>

<p>“It’s up with our main-topsails, lads, and after her
away,” sang Billy in his glory as he gave the engine
more gas.</p>

<p>They could not seem to lessen the distance between
the escaping thieves and their own boat, however, even
though the pursuers, knowing the local waters well,
were able to take some short cuts.</p>

<p>“Well, their launch is a lee-tle speedier than mine,”
wofully admitted Billy.</p>

<p>“But they’re not gaining much, Bill! Let’s keep it
up to the finish!” urged Fred.</p>

<p>Down through Gilkey’s Harbour, out past Job’s Island,
and into East Penobscot Bay, the thieves led
the chase.</p>

<p>“Say, Cap’n, can’t I fire a shot across their bows?”
begged Billy.</p>

<p>“Might as well, son,” replied the Captain.</p>

<p>But the thieves paid no attention to this nautical
command to stop.</p>

<p>“They must be headin’ fer Pulpit Harbour, on
North Haven,” declared the Captain, taking his bearings.</p>

<p>Billy simply couldn’t stand the thought of their getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
away. “Oh, Captain, just let me take one shot
at their boat!”</p>

<p>The Captain hesitated too long, for silence gives
consent. So Billy, quick to take advantage of it,
aimed for the engine of the fleeing launch.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! you hit it!” yelled Paul, excitedly.</p>

<p>“You winged her all right!” admitted Captain Ed,
with a grin of satisfaction now that the deed was done.</p>

<p>After that they drew up on the crippled boat and
were close behind when she dashed in behind the big
rock that marks the entrance to this blind harbour on
North Haven.</p>

<p>Then the thieves beached their launch and took to
the woods. When the Sunset Islanders landed and
examined the deserted launch, they found she was
nearly out of gasoline as well as having had one of her
spark plugs shot away.</p>

<p>“Guess she just had to put in here&mdash;she couldn’t go
much further,” said Fred.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’re any Pulpit Rock fellers&mdash;I
know all the folks ’round here ’cause my wife’s a
North Haven woman, you know,” remarked the Captain.</p>

<p>“Oh, joy! Here’s our lobsters!” shouted Dudley,
with great relief.</p>

<p>“And what’s this?” cried Paul, holding up the cushions
and steamer-rugs from Uncle Billy’s launch.</p>

<p>“Well, I swan!” breathed the Captain amazed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
“Lobsters is one thing, but when it comes to taking
<em>chattels</em>&mdash;that’s another!”</p>

<p>“What’re we going to do now, Cap’n?” asked Billy.</p>

<p>“I’m awful hungry!” hinted Paul.</p>

<p>“Guess it must be most noon,” ventured Dudley.</p>

<p>The Captain and Fred laughed and assured the boys
that it couldn’t be more than six or seven o’clock.
The sun was shining gloriously and being up so early
made the boys think it was ages since the hurry-call
for the chase.</p>

<p>“We’ll have breakfast at my father-in-law’s,” was
the Captain’s welcome announcement, indicating a
white house that showed above the trees on the point.</p>

<p>“Let’s take out our spark-plug as well as the one
left in the other launch,” advised Fred, acting upon
his suggestion.</p>

<p>Captain Jotham, Captain Ed’s father-in-law, was a
jolly old man with a fringe of white whiskers framing
his apple-red face, while his upper lip was carefully
shaven.</p>

<p>“Well, well! hain’t seen ye since a month o’ Sundays!”
was his hearty welcome to his son-in-law.
“Come in&mdash;come in and set!”</p>

<p>Then the old Captain’s motherly wife appeared and
soon after, the hungry mariners were “stokin’ up” on
coffee and doughnuts, with two kinds of pie cut in generous
triangles.</p>

<p>The boys exchanged looks of intense delight&mdash;the
dream of their lives come true! They had heard about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
New Englanders eating pie and doughnuts for breakfast,
but they had deemed it a legend for they had
never had an opportunity to test the truth. Now, they
found they were quite equal to the fact, although Mrs.
Remington would have been horrified at her boys eating
such a morning meal!</p>

<p>When the story of the get-away and pursuit of the
thieves was finished, Captain Jotham planned with
Captain Ed how to capture the marauders.</p>

<p>“Anyway, Ed, I’m the Consta<em>bule</em>, you know!”</p>

<p>“Sure ’nough! And you’ll be doin’ your duty to
nab them rascals,” assented Captain Ed.</p>

<p>So, armed with an old Winchester, Constable
Jotham Heald left the house followed by the rest of
the party&mdash;Billy also armed with his trusty rifle.
Hearing the exciting story, one neighbour after another
joined the posse in the quest.</p>

<p>“Say, Jotham!” bawled an old salt just back from
Rockland, “Bet’cher them fellers air the same es is
wanted fer other things than lobsters!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Jotham! I heared tell thar war a
launch stolen down Camden way&mdash;thar’s a reward out
fer news of the thieves and the launch&mdash;shoulden’
wonder but what this is it!” added another hearty
fisherman, as they passed the thieves’ craft.</p>

<p>The hope of reward added to the zest of the pursuit
and before they left the shore every active or able
member of the settlement had joined the posse and had
spent that reward!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Meantime, the thieves had reached a remote part of
the wooded shore and fearing capture had hidden in
a natural cave. Here, they collected a heap of stones
to use for ammunition and provided heavy clubs in
case of attack.</p>

<p>They had not anticipated such an army, however,
but had intended “rushing” the boys, figuring that the
single rifle of the offensives could be rendered useless
by the sudden surprise.</p>

<p>The trail grew clearer to the “home defenders” as
they neared the granite cave; even Paul could see that
cobble-stones had recently been removed from the
ground.</p>

<p>The two fugitives, hearing a babel of many voices,
peered from the gloom of the cave. When they saw
the crowd headed by a constable (as was distinctly
shown by the badge of office shining resplendent from
his flowered suspenders) with a gun, they looked at
each other in fear.</p>

<p>“In the name of the law, surrender!” bawled Captain
Jotham, aiming his Winchester at the dark opening
of the cave.</p>

<p>With the actual cowardliness of the unarmed criminal,
the two men sneaked out holding up their trembling
hands in token of submission.</p>

<p>“Where’s them bracelets, Ed?” shouted the constable.</p>

<p>And the two men were handcuffed while the crowd
looked on in intense satisfaction. It was the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
the boys had ever seen handcuffs used and it had a most
subduing effect on their plastic minds.</p>

<p>It was high noon when the posse dispersed before
the Heald homestead, and hunger added to fatigue had
so quieted the Islanders that they presented quite a
contrast to the eager rush and hullabaloo of the morning.</p>

<p>Captain Jotham’s wife, accustomed as she was to
hearty appetites, had provided amply for the demand.
Hot biscuits, jam, honey, preserves, and more pie
fraternised on the checkered red-and-white table cloth,
while smothered haddock and boiled potatoes provided
pyramids of delicious if humble provender. And
full justice was done that meal by the Representatives
of the Law!</p>

<p>The topic of conversation centred about the reward
and Captain Jotham promised to take charge of the division
so that the Islanders would receive their exact
share.</p>

<p>“But don’t set your hopes too high, boys&mdash;you won’t
be millionaires on that reward&mdash;if we get it!” said
the constable.</p>

<p>“Why, the whole launch ain’t wuth more’n a hundred,
or even less!” added Captain Ed.</p>

<p>That morning, Mose had been awakened by the
noise of Billy’s launch as the boys started in pursuit of
the thieves. By the time he was half-dressed, however,
and down by the float only a chugging of the
two engines could be heard by the nonplussed cook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
The morning passed without sight or sound of the
Islanders so Mose became worried. He tramped back
and forth from Treasure Cove to the float-stage and
then down to the South End, dragging the spy-glass
with him.</p>

<p>He <em>almost</em> forgot to eat so deserted and worried was
he. Then, late in the afternoon, when it seemed to
him that he was doomed to remain a Second Robinson
Crusoe and Man Friday combined in one, he heard
a faint echo over the water, and anxiously glued his
eye to the spy-glass. There were familiar forms approaching
in Billy’s launch!</p>

<p>Mose was so relieved to find them all safe at home
that the unusually wide grin on his generous mouth
almost met at the back of his round head and elicited
a warning from the Captain:</p>

<p>“Take care, Mose, the top of your head will come
off!”</p>

<p>The whole thrilling tale of the adventure was told
Mose while they all sat about the supper-table, and
many were the interruptions in the telling as one or
another boy remembered a detail of that chase and
capture.</p>

<p>While waiting for dessert, the boys nodded and
dozed, and finally, Fred yawned and got up from the
table.</p>

<p>“Say, Mose, I’m so tired my jaws won’t move!
Keep my dish of pudding for breakfast.”</p>

<p>When the other boys followed Fred’s action, Mose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
could hardly believe his eyes and ears&mdash;not wait for
their favourite pudding!</p>

<p>The next morning Anna appeared with her charge,
Teddy. “I got a letter from your mother yesterday
that she’ll be home soon, so I thought I’d better come
over and help Mose clear away the too-apparent traces
of your ‘bachelor-hall.’”</p>

<p>Although the boys would not admit it, they were
glad to see little Teddy and Anna again, and Fred
picked up his brother and carried him off for the time
the governess was occupied in helping Mose.</p>

<p>As they worked, Mose remarked: “‘Deed Ah
t’ink it’s high time d’ Missus is comin’ home. Ah tek
notice dat none ob dese ’ructions ob bein’ pirates er
shootin’ thieves happen when she’s heah!”</p>

<p>“I agree with you there, Mose, but I think we’re
lucky to have any Islanders sound and alive to meet
her at the homecoming,” added Anna, with a sigh.</p>

<p>The day the Lady of the Island was expected, the
boys started for Rosemary to meet her there. Everything
had been left in readiness at the foot of the flag-pole
so that Mose could hoist the flag when the signal
came from the returning launch. At that signal, the
young Islanders were to sing “My Country ’tis of
Thee” and “Our America,” while the flag was hoisted
and waved from its position on the big rock of Treasure
Cove.</p>

Everything went off as planned, and Mrs. Remington
was greatly pleased at the demonstration of patriotism
shown by the young folks.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it happened that your father
and I never had the broken flag-staff replaced this
summer, but so much takes place every time he is with
us, that it naturally was left for a time when there
was nothing else to do and that never happens!” explained
Mrs. Remington, in apology for the neglect.
Then added:</p>

<p>“Now, however, we have a far better staff than the
old one and I want to thank you for the forethought
and labour.”</p>

<p>“You must thank Captain Ed, too&mdash;he helped a
lot!” said truthful and loyal Billy.</p>

<p>“Indeed I do, and he knows it! And for all his
care of you,” said his mother, taking Captain Ed’s
hand in hers.</p>

<p>At the earnest words of appreciation the Captain’s
memory reviewed recent events&mdash;piracy and posse
were hardly to be considered as acts of care-taking,
and the conscientious Captain’s sense of justice rebuked
him in accepting the gratitude.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” thought he to himself, “‘all’s well that
ends well’ and no one got in trouble!”</p>

<p>Elizabeth and Edith had accompanied their mother
home and were glad to be back on their dear old island,
although they had enjoyed their visit immensely.</p>

<p>The morning following Mrs. Remington’s return,
Elizabeth said, “Mother, we want our annual clam-bake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
and it can’t be postponed much longer ’cause Trixie
is going back home!”</p>

<p>“Well, Uncle Tom is coming over to-day to give the
boys another lesson in target-shooting and we will give
him the invitation to carry to the Cove people, and
we can tell the Isola Bella family about it when we go
there to dinner to-night!”</p>

<p>“Gee! I’m glad we got those lobsters of ours back
again!” murmured Billy.</p>

<p>During the next few days every one worked hard
to have this clam-bake surpass those of former years.
Clams were dug, fish were caught, the Captain’s broilers
were requisitioned, while Rosemary and Isola Bella
promised to supply the ice-cream and cakes.</p>

<p>The day before the fête Elizabeth was brooding
deeply while assisting her mother with candy-making.
Suddenly, she said, “Oh, dear! I do wish father
could be with us to-morrow!”</p>

<p>Her mother smiled and said, “Well, wish hard
enough and see what happens! We used to say ‘If
wishes were horses all beggars might ride,’ but <em>you</em>
might change that to say ‘If wishes are motors our
father will arrive!’”</p>

<p>Elizabeth eyed her mother suspiciously and saw a
look that caused her to clap her hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>mother!</em> goody-good! I know he is coming!”</p>

<p>And away flew Elizabeth to spread the wonderful
news to all on the Island.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s the best yet!” cried the boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
“There’s no one can broil lobsters like father!” declared
Billy.</p>

<p>“And we want him to award that prize he offered
for the biggest one,” added Dudley.</p>

<p>“That’s right. He said ‘in a month’s catch,’ and the
time is up,” admitted Fred.</p>

<p>Eleven A.M. of the great feast-day found Mr. Remington
at Rosemary, the little plan of the extra week-end
visit having been found possible of fulfilment.</p>

<p>Fred and Billy met their father in the new launch.
On the trip to Sunset Island, Billy proudly displayed
its speed and his efficiency in managing the motor.</p>

<p>Fred regaled his father with a very full account of
the pirates and the chase of the thieves to Pulpit Harbour.
As the elder of the trio listened to the story
he chuckled and thought to himself, “Chips of the Old
Block.”</p>

<p>But, very seriously he remarked, “Boys, what did
your mother say to all this?”</p>

<p>“Oh, father! We haven’t told her all we told
<em>you</em>!” gasped they.</p>

<p>And by the time Mrs. Remington did hear most
of the details of the exploits, the flight of time had
shed its halo about the daring and possible dangers
her boys had incurred.</p>

<p>That noon, the sun shone down upon a fleet of visiting
craft loaded with eager and hungry clam-bakers.
Not only were the Rosemary and Isola Bella families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
fully represented but many guests also accompanied
them.</p>

<p>Mr. Remington broiled lobsters, Captain Ed steamed
clams, the boys dished fish-chowder and Mose broiled
young chickens until it seemed the world would be
feasted that day. But all disappeared as if by magic
and still the clam-bakers found out-of-way corners
where cake and ice-cream could be stored!</p>

<p>At last, at peace with all earthly things, the visitors
sat down to enjoy the entertainment about to be furnished
by the Woodcrafters.</p>

<p>“Our first number on the programme will be A
Moving Picture Drama of ‘The Katahdin Pirates,’”
announced Fred.</p>

<p>And a realistic scene took place in which one of the
male visitors was dragged out and became a helpless
victim of piracy as practised by Sunset Islanders.
The production was one of Fred’s first attempts at
play-writing, and received due applause as such.</p>

<p>Little Red Riding Hood was then acted but the
wolf looked suspiciously like the cinnamon bear of
the masked ball on Isola Bella. The wood-chopper
played his part so enthusiastically that it brought an
encore, and so Edith was once more swallowed in the
steamer-rugs of her grandmother’s bed, and once more
disgorged.</p>

<p>After this, Mr. Remington very seriously announced
that the prize offered by him for the largest and heaviest
lobster came near to being twins. The only point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
that saved this awful monstrosity was the fact that a
claw on one was larger than those of the other! Thus,
Paul was recompensed for his encounter with a lobster’s
claw during the first “catch” of the season.</p>

<p>Paul was so delighted with winning the first prize
that he went about showing each guest the claws of the
fine lobster he had caught&mdash;and promising Trixie a
print of the photograph he had taken of it the day before.</p>

<p>Dancing in the Council Ring helped digestion and
the victrola Uncle Tom brought over that day furnished
music.</p>

<p>Among other farewells that evening, Trixie’s were
especially prolonged as she was to leave Rosemary on
the morrow.</p>

<p>During his unexpected visit of three days, Mr. Remington
took an active interest in the target practice
and the boys received many important and wise advices.</p>

<p>With target-practice, fishing, canoeing, and other
sports, the days flew by, while weekly councils in the
Ring marked the attainment of Woodcraft Honours.</p>

<p>The outdoor life had tanned and hardened Paul and
Dudley so that they were a credit to the Island.
Moreover, the boys were now of real service in camp
life, having learned to row, be of help in sailing, expert
in swimming, knowing something of first aid, and
being able to cook a simple camp meal.</p>

<p>Then came a letter in the morning mail one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
and upon reading it Mrs. Remington announced:
“Mrs. Baker says the trip is all arranged. The girls
of Wickeecheokee Band and the boys of the Grey Fox
Band are crazy to come with Dr. Baker and Mr. Hubert
when they motor to Maine. So she has changed
her plans of coming with the doctor.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s too bad! I know she would have enjoyed
a visit with you, mother,” said Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“What will they do, then?” asked Billy eagerly,
trying to hide his pleasure at hearing that Fiji and
Bob Baker would accompany the doctor instead of
Mrs. Baker.</p>

<p>“Why, Mr. Hubert will take the big touring car and
take Janet, Zan Baker, Nita Brampton, Elena Marsh
and Paul’s sister Hilda&mdash;the original five who started
Wickeecheokee Band of Wako Tribe, while Dr.
Baker will use his new seven-passenger car to carry
Fiji and Bob Baker, Jack Hubert, Harold Everett and
the luggage.”</p>

<p>“Why, Jane and Jack Hubert are with their mother
at Woodchuck Camp in the Adirondacks!” exclaimed
Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Yes, but Mrs. Baker and Miss Miller are going
from the city to the Hubert Camp and visit there while
Jane and Jack take the two places in the cars to come
on here with the other Woodcrafters,” explained Mrs.
Remington.</p>

<p>Wild expressions of delight came from every boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
and girl present and then Billy quieted them with a
practical remark.</p>

<p>“Say, those Bands won’t let us put anything over
on them in a Grand Council, I bet!”</p>

<p>“That’s right! We ought to put on steam and show
the Grey Foxes what <em>we</em> have done this summer!”
cried Dudley.</p>

<p>“Fiji Baker told my sister that they meant to ‘saw
wood’ on the farm this summer, so’s they could show
‘<em>some</em>’ work at the Grand Council in New York in the
fall,” added Paul.</p>

<p>“What’s more, they must have known of this visit
some time ago, and been hitting it up to show off when
they get here,” suggested Fred.</p>

<p>“Say, boys, wouldn’t it be great fun to hold one
mighty Council with the Pentagoet Tribe as host together
with the girls of The Big Lodge of Wako Tribe,
and their Little Lodge where Paul, Edith and Teddy
first started in Woodcraft Work?” volunteered Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget the Grey Foxes, too!” added Dudley.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, let’s! I want to show Hilda how I have
improved this summer,” urged Paul.</p>

<p>The others smiled encouragingly at the boy in whom
there surely had been miracles wrought since he joined
Woodcraft. In place of the whining and discontented
ways he had acquired a happy optimism; the shirking
of duties was now a forgotten habit, the irregular eating,
oversleeping, prevarications and other undesirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
qualities were now gone for good. And good normal
ideas and character-forming exercises took their place.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Baker said, that the doctor has been so over-worked
that he needs a change, so Mr. Hubert planned
this outing to entice him. They will motor from the
Adirondacks in easy stages and then spend the third
week-end of August in Camden, so that we can have
them over to visit the Island for a day at least!” said
Mrs. Remington, looking again at the letter from Mrs.
Baker.</p>

<p>“If we hold that last Grand Council when the visiting
Tribes are here why not let that occasion be used
to crown Fred a Sagamore? He has just won his
twenty-fourth feather with the sailing <em>coup</em>,” suggested
Elizabeth, eagerly.</p>

<p>“That is a splendid idea, Lizzie!” cried Billy, using
that tabooed nickname for his sister.</p>

<p>“We can have some grand water sports as well as
other fun,” instantly quoth Fred, to cover the too
evident pleasure he felt at the proposition.</p>

<p>“We can have a ‘Spearing the Sturgeon,’ a canoe
tag, and a tub-tilting contest as well as a Talk Fest
and other fun!” said Dudley, anxious to add his quota.</p>

<p>“Say, don’t you boys go and forget we girls are in
on this Council!” warned Elizabeth, with a menacing
look.</p>

<p>“Of course!” responded Paul, magnanimously.</p>

<p>“And we’re going to claim Honours for different
things, too! I’m going to finish my Hostess and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Shingebis Degrees as well as my Handicraft <em>coups</em>,”
continued Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“I guess those girls of Wako Tribe will have some
stunts to show, too,” added Edith.</p>

<p>“I think I will plan a programme that will give each
Woodcrafter time and opportunity to show what he
or she has done this summer,” suggested Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, do that!” came a chorus of voices, so
the Lady of the Island produced an elaborate programme
that later was entered in the Tally Book as
one of the Grand Councils&mdash;and the best ever held on
the Island.</p>

<p>From that day until the time the expected tourists
were to arrive, many hours were given to finishing up
the lists for claiming <em>coups</em> and Honours.</p>

<p>Birds, flowers, insects and fish were catalogued and
learned by every one until the required number for
each <em>coup</em> or honour were secured.</p>

<p>Athletics and Camp Crafts were displayed to the
necessary witnesses until Fred declared that he would
demand the pay for the office for Recording Secretary
if the writing kept up much longer.</p>

<p>But all mundane things have an end and so has the
waiting for an important event.</p>

<p>Uncle Bill and Mr. Remington met at last on their
‘insular plane’ just before the arrival of the guests
at Camden. They proved to be of great assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
when it came to arranging the rules and regulations
of the water-sports planned.</p>

<p>Then the day the touring cars arrived at Rosemary,
every Islander was up and ready to jump into the
launch immediately after breakfast. They intended to
act as escort for Uncle Tom’s power-boat which would
convey the visitors.</p>

<p>The Council Ring had been elaborately decorated
with totems painted on the round and oval bread-boards
salvaged from the wrecked Katahdin, and flags
waved in the breeze&mdash;the glorious Stars and Stripes
evident above all.</p>

<small>THE TWENTY-FOURTH FEATHER</small></h2>


<p class="noi"><span class="dropcap">E</span>ARLY in the morning of the festive day, Mose
came to Mrs. Remington with a question expressed
in his troubled eyes.</p>

<p>“We ain’t got dishes enough, nohow, fer de big
crowd yo’ all is expectin’,” said he.</p>

<p>“Why, Mose! What about all those shooks of
wooden plates salvaged from the wreck&mdash;and the other
wooden things?” said she.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ah diden’ know yo’ all woul’ want t’ use dem
fo’ Noo Yoak comp’ny,” apologised Mose, who wanted
to put “the best foot foremost” with expected strangers.</p>

<p>“You know, it isn’t the dishes they’ll notice, Mose,
but what’s on them!” declared Mrs. Remington wisely.</p>

<p>“Ah s’pose so!” conceded the half-convinced cook.</p>

<p>The Great Convocation having safely arrived on
Sunset Island, the morning was devoted to all sorts of
athletics and water-sport contests.</p>

<p>The Grey Fox boys acquitted themselves admirably
for such young beginners in Woodcraft, and they
seized the chance in the presence of so many witnesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
to win <em>coups</em> for “chinning the bar,” “hop, step, and
jump” and other games.</p>

<p>The canoe-tag was a laughable affair&mdash;naturally, the
contestants wore bathing suits. Uncle Tom and Uncle
Bill loaned their canoes to the visitors for the day.</p>

<p>“Tell you what, boys, this makes me feel young
again!” exclaimed Uncle Bill, as he laughed at certain
tricks.</p>

<p>“Why, Uncle Bill! You’re not old,” defended Billy.</p>

<p>“No indeed, he is just as young as any of us!” said
Fred.</p>

<p>“About as young as Teddy, for instance,” laughed
Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“Yes, as young and as foolish,” added Aunt Miriam.</p>

<p>And Uncle Bill quickly diverted every one’s attention
to a beautiful schooner ploughing through the
waves of the bay.</p>

<p>That day the luncheon was a picnic affair, for all of
the Rosemary and Isola Bella relatives brought huge
hampers of food. Immediately after the lunch a cleanup
brigade got rid of the debris before the final preparations
were made for the Grand Council.</p>

<p>Then, the boys’ and girls’ tents were filled with
excited Woodcrafters adding the finishing touches to
their ceremonial costumes. For, whatever else was
lacking in the suitcases of the Wako Girls and Grey
Fox Boys, it was not the tiniest or bulkiest item of
their Woodcraft Council Robes! No indeed!</p>

<p>Three o’clock found a goodly company completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
circling the Council Place. Besides relatives and
families of the captains present other visitors had arrived
after luncheon.</p>

<p>Wita-tonkan opened the Council and called upon
Fiji, the Chief of the Grey Foxes, to make the ceremonial
rubbing-stick fire, also appointing Zan Baker,
Founder of Wickeecheokee Band, Tally Keeper of
the Council, thus conforming to the conditions of
courtesy and co-operation.</p>

<p>When the Chief of the Council called for reports of
Scouts, a surprise was afforded the Pentagoets.</p>

<p>Captain Ed rose, saluted, was recognised, and began
in an official Woodcraft manner:</p>

<p>“Oh Chief! I have to report that Consta<em>bule</em> Jotham
Heald sent word that $15 reward awaits at the
Camden Police Station for you boys’ share of the
money paid by the owner of the recovered launch.”</p>

<p>After the excited applause had subsided, Billy sprang
up, saluted, and inquired earnestly, “Oh Chief! I
would like to ask the Captain if we aren’t going to get
anything for helping capture those thieves?”</p>

<p>Every one in the Council laughed at Billy’s mercenary
tendencies.</p>

<p>“Oh Chief! I will answer the young Brave’s question!”
cried Uncle Bill, now jumping up. “We all
admire and value the astuteness of this young detective’s
work and I fear that my namesake has had his
hopes buoyed high from having read of the
<a name="exorbitant" id="exorbitant"></a><ins title="Original has exhorbitant">exorbitant</ins><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
rewards obtained by city “tecs”; however, let me assure
him that most of those sums are press stories and
the ‘long green’ is seldom seen by the hard-plugging
officers whose families have to live according to the
‘low-cost menus’ furnished by some philanthropic
magazines&mdash;on two and a half cents a day!”</p>

<p>Billy’s face had gradually been changing its expression
of eagerness to disappointment, so the Captain
explained:</p>

<p>“The talk of a reward for the thieves was mostly
just talk! In fact, the launch-owner added an extra
five to the five dollars reward for catching the rascals.
But we were quite a posse, you know, so it only
amounted to thirty-seven cents a piece, when divided.”</p>

<p>Fumbling through his pockets, the conscientious
Captain finally brought forth a yellow cotton bag once
filled with “cut plug” but now elevated to the position
of a bank.</p>

<p>“The constabule” had made an exact division of
spoils grading down to some odd pennies, and this was
counted out upon the desk of the Tally Keeper.</p>

<p>The boys were slightly disappointed at the sudden
collapse of the financial investments they had dreamed
about, but they were good losers and insisted that Captain
Ed share the reward with them.</p>

<p>When order was once more restored, Uncle Tom
made his report on target practice. Amid prolonged
applause, the first prize was a pocket-rifle and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
awarded to Billy. The second prize was a sheath-knife
which went to Dudley.</p>

<p>Under the heading of “unfinished business” Wita-tonkan
called upon the Pentagoets and visitors present
at the Black Bear Day, to deliver the rest of the scalps
still due the victors in that contest.</p>

<p>Uncle Bill rose and said: “Oh Chief, I permitted
my hair to grow all of the time I was away from here.
Now, behold, the result!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he held aloft a magnificent pendant
brush of long shining hair which he had had made to
order. This truly royal trophy was then solemnly
hung on the Black Bear totem-pole back of the Chief’s
chair.</p>

<p>In turn, the rest of the scalps were hung beneath it,
Uncle Tom and some of the visitors having provided
variegated locks: crimson, yellow, green, purple, and
blue tassels of horsehair.</p>

<p>“How! How!” sounded amid laughter in the Council
Ring.</p>

<p>“Any Honours to be claimed?” questioned the
Chief.</p>

<p>Fiji and Bob stood up and presented the signed
papers for a canning <em>coup</em> each. They had joined a
Government Canning Club and at Wickeecheokee
Farm that summer had canned twelve quarts each of
strawberries, cherries and raspberries, making the
three dozen necessary for a <em>coup</em>.</p>

<p>“When will you give a demonstration of your club-work?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
I’d like to be one of the judges and chief
taster,” asked Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>This gave the Woodcrafters an idea for a Thanksgiving
exhibition which they really carried out the
ensuing winter.</p>

<p>Then, Dudley, Paul, Billy and Fred claimed the <em>coup</em>
for catching and salting fish, each having more than
the twenty-five to their account.</p>

<p>Wita-tonkan having awarded these <em>coups</em> a question
was raised as to the fitting person to award the Honour
to him.</p>

<p>“A Chief must receive Honours from another
Chief,” announced Zan, the Tally Keeper.</p>

<p>“Will the Grey Fox Chief award this Honour to
the Chief of the Pentagoet Tribe?” added she, turning
to her brother.</p>

<p>Fiji acquitted himself with dignity, although it was
the first time that he had been called upon to act in this
capacity.</p>

<p>Various Nature and Handcraft <em>coups</em> were claimed
by both girls and boys, and Elizabeth, representing her
home tribe of the Apawamis, was awarded the Degrees
of Hostess and Sister Craft.</p>

<p>Edith, Dudley and Paul, each claimed a <em>coup</em> for
knowing twenty-five fish; the two boys announcing
that, before they left the island that summer, they
hoped to have their Grand <em>Coups</em> for sleeping out of
doors sixty successive nights.</p>

“If I hadn’t had to go to Rosemary and sleep in
Aunt Edith’s house when mother went to Boston, I
could have won that Grand <em>coup</em>, too!” grumbled
Edith.</p>

<p>Some one wondered why Wita-tonkan wore only
his plain head-band at this important Council and it
was now explained.</p>

<p>Billy arose and said, “I, Shingebis, of the Black Bear
Tribe, in behalf of Wita-tonkan of the Black Bear
Tribe, claim <em>coup</em> for sailing without expert help, one
hundred and fifty miles in a season. Witnessed by
Captain Ed Blake, Moses Jackson, and Elizabeth Remington.”</p>

<p>A pause was broken by Shingebis, who gazed
solemnly at the circle of attentive faces and said
impressively: “This is Wita-tonkan’s twenty-fourth
<em>coup</em> and entitles him to the Sagamore ship!”</p>

<p>Fiji, slightly overwhelmed at the duties devolving
upon him, was again called forward to do service to a
Brother Chief.</p>

<p>Zan and Elizabeth handed the Grey Fox Chief the
Sagamore’s war-bonnet and the twenty-fourth symbol.
Fiji reverently inserted the feather, then, holding
aloft the coveted plumes he called upon Elizabeth
to read aloud to the Council, the exploits symbolised
by this Sagamore’s Crown.</p>

<p>With a feeling of great pride in her brother’s
achievement, Pah-hlee-oh, the Moon-maid, read as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>As the long salvo of “Hows!” died away over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
water, Fiji ceremoniously placed the Crown upon the
new-made Sagamore.</p>

<p>Every Woodcraft boy and girl present then in turn
saluted the Sagamore Wita-tonkan, which salute was
his due every time he entered any Council thereafter.</p>

<p>In a few words of intense feeling, Wita-tonkan
thanked the Chief of the Grey Foxes and the Council,
then took again his place in the Chair.</p>

<p>The full programme was given that day. The
Wako Tribe rendering the Corn Dance in a finished
and graceful manner. Fiji and Bob stood off Billy
and Paul in contests of tub-tilting and then the Pentagoet
Tribe gave a good account of themselves in singing
and movies.</p>

<p>Just before the close of that Grand Council Uncle
Bill, Uncle Tom, and Mr. Remington made a momentous
announcement.</p>

<p>“We have persuaded Dr. Baker and Mr. Hubert,
acting as chauffeurs for these Woodcraft visitors, to
pronounce the two automobiles out of condition for an
immediate departure. Therefore, they have agreed to
extend the visit,” said Uncle Bill.</p>

<p>“Yes, the Grey Foxes are going to be the guests
of the Sunset Islanders, while the Wakos will visit
Isola Bella,” continued Mr. Remington.</p>

<p>“And the doctor and Mr. Hubert are to remain with
me at Rosemary where we three can chaperone the unruly
cars,” added Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>But long before the third announcement was finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
a babel started in the Council Ring and could only
be subdued by the Sagamore jumping up and shouting
wildly:</p>

<p>“Three cheers and a tiger!”</p>

<p>The order was obeyed with a vim that deafened all
those present, and echoed as far over to Isola Bella so
that Bridget came out of her domain and stood with
hands upon her ample hips, remarking to herself:
“Some more av thim Injun fussin’s Oi s’pose.”</p>

<p>Oh, the joys of the next few days! Fishing, sailing&mdash;for
the visitors preferred sailing to any other
sport&mdash;and exploring the islands; a visit to the old
wreck in Crow Cove, an impromptu clam-bake, and
dances in Fudge Attic of evenings where Uncle Bill
made good his boast to the members of Wako Tribe&mdash;that
he was strong for the ladies!</p>

<p>On the morning of the last day, however, Dr. Baker
and Mr. Hubert silenced all petitions for a longer
visit. So, the launches were boarded and the visiting
Woodcrafters and all of the Islanders were soon
carried over to Rosemary where the well-chaperoned
cars had been waiting.</p>

<p>“Say, Fiji, while the folks are admiring Uncle
Tom’s garden s’posing we show you boys the farm,”
asked Fred.</p>

<p>“And we’ll show you the little pig we saved from the
Katahdin wreck,” cried Billy.</p>

<p>This idea was acted upon and soon the boys and
girls were laughing at the antics of the pig, now in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
excellent condition owing to the generosity of the
Rosemary refectory.</p>

<p>As they all stood near the pen, Fiji began whistling
a medley beginning with Yankee Doodle, when, to the
amazement of the children, piggy instantly reared up
on his hind legs and danced about, keeping very good
time with the whistling.</p>

<p>“Well, did you ever!” gasped Zan, turning to look
at the others.</p>

<p>The boys and girls of the Island were as surprised
as she, however, and stood speechless, looking at the
object of their unbelief.</p>

<p>“Say, that’s no fool of a pig! I’m going to try him
again!” exclaimed Fiji.</p>

<p>Katahdin had dropped to all fours when the musician
had stopped whistling and now came snuffling close to
the fence for an accustomed apple.</p>

<p>“I’ll run to the orchard for some apples!” cried
Billy, while Fiji started to whistle again.</p>

<p>Piggy again danced around and around causing
the audience to shriek with laughter.</p>

<p>“I bet you anything that’s a trick pig!” cried Fred.</p>

<p>“And it was crated for the County Fair&mdash;yes sir!”
added Paul.</p>

<p>“Let me try some other stunts,” suggested Fiji,
climbing over the fence.</p>

<p>Bob handed his brother a stick of wood while the
other children waited breathlessly to see the results of
the experiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Fiji ordered in a commanding voice “Down, Piggy, down!”</p>

<p>Immediately, the pig lay down upon the ground.</p>

<p>“Dead dog, Dead!” now called the excited boy, forgetting
for the moment that he was not training
Wickee, his collie dog.</p>

<p>But Katahdin cared naught for the error of names,
and meekly turned over on his back with all four short
legs sticking stiffly upward.</p>

<p>A scream of laughter greeted this performance and
an apple was fed the eager pig.</p>

<p>“Fiji, see if he can play soldier like Wick does?”
now said Bob. So, the stick Fiji held was carefully
placed in the crotch of the upright pig’s foreleg. The
pig was so tame that it showed absolutely no fear of
the children but stood obediently waiting for a command.</p>

<p>Whistling Yankee Doodle again, Fiji shouted
“March!”</p>

<p>Katahdin ambled clumsily along carrying the stick
for a gun, and the children shouted wildly in their
frenzy of delight. They felt that they had saved the
seventh wonder of the earth!</p>

<p>“Halt!” called Fiji, and the porcine performer
obeyed.</p>

<p>“Present arms!” but the pig must have been accustomed
to a different act for it instantly grounded
arms.</p>

<p>Uncles, aunts, and other adults were now hailed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
come and witness the great surprise. So piggy was
once more put through his “steps” to the wonderment
of the grown-ups.</p>

<p>“I believe this is a valuable pig, children, and perhaps
his master was on the Katahdin also, and now is
mourning the loss of his pet,” said Mrs. Remington.</p>

<p>“Suppose we write the Eastern Steamship Company
to ascertain who the owner is, or just why this pig
was shipped on the Katahdin,” suggested Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>“Of course, the address was on the crate but was
soaked off that day on Scilly Ledge,” said Paul, regretfully.</p>

<p>“I think Uncle Tom’s plan the best&mdash;will you write
at once, please?” said Billy.</p>

<p>“This very day!” vowed Uncle Tom.</p>

<p>“Oh, do let us hear from you, will you, Mr. Charlton?
and tell us what you find out about Katahdin?”
cried Zan, eagerly, as they walked towards the waiting
automobiles.</p>

<p>“Indeed, I will! The Sunset Islanders saved piggy’s
life from a watery grave, but the Grey Foxes
saved him from the butcher’s blade!” exclaimed Uncle
Tom.</p>

<p>Then, amid shrill whistles, waving of caps and hats,
and other forms of farewell, the two cars started away
carrying a pleased party of visitors out of sight.</p>

<p>A week passed without a reply to Uncle Tom’s letter
and every one began worrying lest they would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
to go back home without having found Katahdin’s
rightful owner.</p>

<p>Then came a bulky letter from the company. It
contained letters written to a man in the Rockland
hospital and his replies. They all pertained to the
pig. After reading them, Uncle Tom smiled and
started for Sunset Island with the information.</p>

<p>“Well, Islanders! What to do about that pig?”
asked he.</p>

<p>“Goodness me! Haven’t you had <em>any</em> word, yet?”
worried Paul.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking that I’d better hand him over
to the Captain, if we have to go without finding another
owner,” said Uncle Tom, pretending not to hear
Paul’s question.</p>

<p>This caused a disquieting silence although the boys
were very fond of Captain Ed; still each one had
secretly hoped to take the pig home himself, if no other
home had been found.</p>

<p>Uncle Tom laughed heartily for he read their
thoughts correctly, and felt that he had taken an unfair
advantage of them. So, he took the bundle of
letters from his pocket and motioned the children to
be seated.</p>

<p>The letters proved that the owner of the trick pig
was the only passenger injured when the Katahdin
was wrecked, and if he had not tried to save the life
of his beloved pet&mdash;his only source of livelihood, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
would have been spared some broken ribs. But, upon
hearing the frightened squeals coming from the pig
that was kept in a crate, the poor man endeavoured to
drag the box on deck and thus was struck by a falling
spar.</p>

<p>The crew carried him to the lifeboat but he wanted
to go back for his pig! They held him fast, however,
and sent him to the hospital for attention. In his
delirium he called and called for his pig, ordering it to
perform or calling it by endearing names when an act
was well done.</p>

<p>The nurses noted this and reported to the doctor
and the kindly doctor in turn reported to the authorities.
Then, after hope had almost gone, came the
letter from Uncle Tom. To say the poor man felt joy
and relief at hearing that his pet was alive and so well
cared for, was putting it mildly. The letter he sent
Uncle Tom was simply overflowing with gratitude.</p>

<p>Before the Islanders left Maine to return to their
city home, Uncle Tom came for them to hurry back
with him to Rosemary and meet the owner of
Katahdin.</p>

<p>Here, the pale but happy man shook hands with the
children and thanked them repeatedly for what they
had unconsciously done for him.</p>

<p>“You see, when I first went on that boat, I wanted
Pico&mdash;that’s his right name&mdash;in my state-room with
me but the steamship company wouldn’t allow it, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
they put him in a crate and put the poor thing down
in the room with the freight! Ah, me! How Pico
must have suffered from fright that time when the
ship hit those rocks! And after, when he was in
the sea!”</p>

<p>The young pirates could have testified to the fear
the poor pig felt as shown by his wildness and squeals
that day on the Zeus, but it would not have helped
the still weakened man to hear that story so nothing
was told him about the rescue.</p>

<p>The Islanders stood watching the happy owner
strap the new crate on the back of the buckboard he
had hired, and when he drove way, turning now and
then to wave to the children, they sighed.</p>

<p>“Say, do you know what?” exclaimed Billy, suddenly.</p>

<p>“No, what?” demanded the others.</p>

<p>“Of all the adventures we’ve had at Sunset Island
this summer, I’m not so sure but that saving Pico for
this lonely man isn’t the deed to be recorded in our
Tally as being of the most value and importance!”</p>

<p>And every one seconded Billy’s heartfelt motion.</p>

<p>The last days on Sunset Island came all too soon
and after such a wonderful summer of freedom and
pleasures, the spectre of school-lessons looming up
with the limitations of city-life, created a zeal to crowd
in all possible sport.</p>

<p>As they all sailed for the last time over the bay to
the Camp-Ground landing where they expected to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
the steamer, the three younger boys thought with regret
that they might have accomplished more than they
really had, but Wita-tonkan felt the glow of satisfaction
that he had realised one of his ambitions of
life&mdash;that of being crowned the Sagamore of Sunset
Island.</p>

<p>“Let your boy grow up with Tom Slade,” is a suggestion
which thousands of parents have followed during the past,
with the result that the TOM SLADE BOOKS are the
most popular boys’ books published today. They take Tom
Slade through a series of typical boy adventures through
his tenderfoot days as a scout, through his gallant days as
an American doughboy in France, back to his old patrol
and the old camp ground at Black Lake, and so on.</p>

<p>In the character and adventures of Roy Blakeley are typified
the very essence of Boy life. He is a real boy, as real as
Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer. He is the moving spirit of
the troop of Scouts of which he is a member, and the average
boy has to go only a little way in the first book before
Roy is the best friend he ever had, and he is willing to part

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
